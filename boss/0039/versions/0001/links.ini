quote = HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy
Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had
two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was
very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of
the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic
tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think
him unpractical, which he really was not.  Why cant you be like the Happy
Prince? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.
The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.  I am glad there is some
one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at
the wonderful statue.  He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children
as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their
clean white pinafores.  How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have
never seen one.  Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His
friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for
he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  Shall I
love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the
Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water
with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it
lasted all through the summer.  It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the
other Swallows, she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the
river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. She has
no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind. And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed
made the most graceful curtsies. I admit that she is domestic, he continued,
but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.  You have been trifling with me, he
cried, I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye! and he flew away.  All day long he
flew, and at night time he arrived at the city. Where shall I put up? he said;
I hope the town has made preparations.  Then he saw the statue on the tall
column. I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position with plenty of
fresh air. So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  I have a
golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared
to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop
of water fell on him. What a curious thing! he cried, there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.  Then another drop fell.  What
is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I must look for
a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened
his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.  Who are you? he said.  I am the Happy
Prince.  Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched
me.  When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a
very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed
I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am
dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all
the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose
but weep.  What, is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  Far away, continued the statue
in a low musical voice, far away in a little street there is a poor house. One
of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her
face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court
ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a
fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring
her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I
cannot move.  I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow. My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go
to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his
painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round
his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me
for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad.  I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow. Last summer, when I was
staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far
too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but
still, it was a mark of disrespect.  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that
the little Swallow was sorry. It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your messenger.  Thank you, little Swallow, said
the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the
cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by
the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the
balcony with her lover. How wonderful the stars are, he said to her, and how
wonderful is the power of love!  I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State ball, she answered; I have ordered passion flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.  At last he came to the poor house and
looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table
beside the womans thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys
forehead with his wings. How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting
better; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to
the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. It is curious, he remarked,
but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.  That is because you have
done a good action, said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and
then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew
down to the river and had a bath. What a remarkable phenomenon, said the
Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. A swallow in
winter! And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one
quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
Tonight I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the
prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed himself very much.  When
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. Have you any commissions for
Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said
the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  I am waited for in
Egypt, answered the Swallow. Tomorrow my friends will fly up to the Second
Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great
granite throne sits the god Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and
when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
At noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. They have eyes
like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the prince, far away across the city I
see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and
in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint.  I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who
really had a good heart. Shall I take him another ruby?  Alas! I have no ruby
now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one
of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play.  Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do
that; and he began to weep.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince,
do as I command you.  So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away
to the students garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his
head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered
violets.  I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great
admirer. Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.  The next day the
Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. Heave a-hoy!
they shouted as each chest came up. I am going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  I am
come to bid you good-bye, he cried.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the
Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  It is winter, answered the
Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the
green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must
leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.  In
the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little match-girl. She
has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father
will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has
no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and
give it to her, and her father will not beat her.  I will stay with you one
night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be
quite blind then.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I
command you.  So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran home,
laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. You are blind now, he
said, so I will stay with you always.  No, little Swallow, said the poor
Prince, you must go away to Egypt.  I will stay with you always, said the
Swallow, and he slept at the Princes feet.  All the next day he sat on the
Princes shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He
told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile,
and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world
itself and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands;
of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and
worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree,
and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.  Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.
There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and
tell me what you see there.  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting
at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving
children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep
themselves warm. How hungry we are! they said. You must not lie here, shouted
the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told
the Prince what he had seen.  I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you
must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf
of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the street. We have bread now! they cried.
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if
they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in
furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor
little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he
loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the bakers door where the baker
was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at
last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the
Princes shoulder once more. Good-bye, dear Prince! he murmured, will you let me
kiss your hand?  I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,
said the Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.  It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow. I
am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?  And
he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At
that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had
broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It
certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning the Mayor was
walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they
passed the column he looked up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy
Prince looks! he said.  How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who
always agreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.  The ruby has
fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said
the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!  Little better than a
beggar said the Town councillors.  And here is actually a dead bird at his
feet! continued the Mayor. We must really issue a proclamation that birds are
not to be allowed to die here. And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the
University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. We
must have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of
myself.  Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  What a strange thing!
said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. This broken lead heart will
not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away. So they threw it on a dust heap
where the dead Swallow was also lying.  Bring me the two most precious things
in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the
leaden heart and the dead bird.  You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of
gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.
True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not
destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How,
then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you
the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain;
but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it
was this!  He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually
--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the
eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But
you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with
what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I
was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it
--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I
put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I
thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it
in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old
man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been
so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I
undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And
this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found
the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not
the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling
him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you
see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth
night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the
extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings
of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and
he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through
fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to
open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said
nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as
I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound
that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the
sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has
welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors
that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake
ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had
been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in
the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain;
because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him,
and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel
the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very
patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very,
very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how
stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of
the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It
was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it
with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that
chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely
upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness
is but over-acuteness of the sense?  --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that
sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my
fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even
yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern
motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and
quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the
night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this
excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a
neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on
with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed
and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon
the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone
dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will
think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the
concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the
legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly,
so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing
wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot
whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I
had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went
down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the
police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of
foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office,
and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,
--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was
my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took
my visitors all over the house.  I bade them search --search well. I led them,
at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In
the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired
them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed
the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued
and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but
it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise
was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more
fluently, and with a heightened voice.  Yet the sound increased --and what
could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch
makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers
heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily
increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent
gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could
I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been
sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and
continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men
chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!
--no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a
mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better
than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now
--again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!  louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked,
"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
the beating of his hideous heart!"

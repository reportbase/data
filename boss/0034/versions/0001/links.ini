quote = HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy
Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had
two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was
very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of
the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic
tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think
him unpractical, which he really was not.  Why cant you be like the Happy
Prince? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.
The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.  I am glad there is some
one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at
the wonderful statue.  He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children
as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their
clean white pinafores.  How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have
never seen one.  Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His
friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for
he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  Shall I
love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the
Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water
with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it
lasted all through the summer.  It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the
other Swallows, she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the
river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. She has
no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind. And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed
made the most graceful curtsies. I admit that she is domestic, he continued,
but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.  You have been trifling with me, he
cried, I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye! and he flew away.  All day long he
flew, and at night time he arrived at the city. Where shall I put up? he said;
I hope the town has made preparations.  Then he saw the statue on the tall
column. I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position with plenty of
fresh air. So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  I have a
golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared
to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop
of water fell on him. What a curious thing! he cried, there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.  Then another drop fell.  What
is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I must look for
a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened
his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.  Who are you? he said.  I am the Happy
Prince.  Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched
me.  When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a
very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed
I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am
dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all
the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose
but weep.  What, is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  Far away, continued the statue
in a low musical voice, far away in a little street there is a poor house. One
of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her
face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court
ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a
fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring
her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I
cannot move.  I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow. My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go
to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his
painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round
his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me
for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad.  I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow. Last summer, when I was
staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far
too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but
still, it was a mark of disrespect.  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that
the little Swallow was sorry. It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your messenger.  Thank you, little Swallow, said
the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the
cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by
the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the
balcony with her lover. How wonderful the stars are, he said to her, and how
wonderful is the power of love!  I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State ball, she answered; I have ordered passion flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.  At last he came to the poor house and
looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table
beside the womans thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys
forehead with his wings. How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting
better; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to
the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. It is curious, he remarked,
but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.  That is because you have
done a good action, said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and
then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew
down to the river and had a bath. What a remarkable phenomenon, said the
Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. A swallow in
winter! And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one
quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
Tonight I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the
prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed himself very much.  When
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. Have you any commissions for
Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said
the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  I am waited for in
Egypt, answered the Swallow. Tomorrow my friends will fly up to the Second
Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great
granite throne sits the god Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and
when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
At noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. They have eyes
like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the prince, far away across the city I
see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and
in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint.  I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who
really had a good heart. Shall I take him another ruby?  Alas! I have no ruby
now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one
of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play.  Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do
that; and he began to weep.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince,
do as I command you.  So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away
to the students garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his
head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered
violets.  I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great
admirer. Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.  The next day the
Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. Heave a-hoy!
they shouted as each chest came up. I am going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  I am
come to bid you good-bye, he cried.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the
Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  It is winter, answered the
Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the
green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must
leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.  In
the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little match-girl. She
has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father
will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has
no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and
give it to her, and her father will not beat her.  I will stay with you one
night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be
quite blind then.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I
command you.  So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran home,
laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. You are blind now, he
said, so I will stay with you always.  No, little Swallow, said the poor
Prince, you must go away to Egypt.  I will stay with you always, said the
Swallow, and he slept at the Princes feet.  All the next day he sat on the
Princes shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He
told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile,
and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world
itself and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands;
of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and
worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree,
and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.  Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.
There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and
tell me what you see there.  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting
at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving
children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep
themselves warm. How hungry we are! they said. You must not lie here, shouted
the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told
the Prince what he had seen.  I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you
must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf
of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the street. We have bread now! they cried.
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if
they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in
furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor
little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he
loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the bakers door where the baker
was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at
last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the
Princes shoulder once more. Good-bye, dear Prince! he murmured, will you let me
kiss your hand?  I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,
said the Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.  It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow. I
am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?  And
he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At
that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had
broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It
certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning the Mayor was
walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they
passed the column he looked up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy
Prince looks! he said.  How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who
always agreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.  The ruby has
fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said
the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!  Little better than a
beggar said the Town councillors.  And here is actually a dead bird at his
feet! continued the Mayor. We must really issue a proclamation that birds are
not to be allowed to die here. And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the
University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. We
must have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of
myself.  Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  What a strange thing!
said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. This broken lead heart will
not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away. So they threw it on a dust heap
where the dead Swallow was also lying.  Bring me the two most precious things
in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the
leaden heart and the dead bird.  You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of
gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.

Quote =  True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not
destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How,
then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you
the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain;
but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it
was this!  He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually
--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the
eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But
you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with
what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I
was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it
--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I
put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I
thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it
in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old
man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been
so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I
undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And
this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found
the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not
the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling
him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you
see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth
night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the
extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings
of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and
he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through
fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to
open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said
nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as
I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound
that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the
sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has
welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors
that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake
ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had
been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in
the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain;
because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him,
and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel
the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very
patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very,
very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how
stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of
the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It
was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it
with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that
chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely
upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness
is but over-acuteness of the sense?  --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that
sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my
fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even
yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern
motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and
quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the
night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this
excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a
neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on
with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed
and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon
the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone
dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will
think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the
concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the
legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly,
so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing
wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot
whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I
had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went
down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the
police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of
foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office,
and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,
--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was
my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took
my visitors all over the house.  I bade them search --search well. I led them,
at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In
the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired
them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed
the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued
and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but
it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise
was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more
fluently, and with a heightened voice.  Yet the sound increased --and what
could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch
makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers
heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily
increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent
gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could
I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been
sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and
continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men
chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!
--no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a
mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better
than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now
--again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!  louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked,
"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
the beating of his hideous heart!"

Quote = One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it
was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer
and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent
imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della
counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
Christmas.  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection
that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles
predominating.  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the
first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per
week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on
the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  In the vestibule below was a letter-box
into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal
finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the
name "Mr. James Dillingham Young." The "Dillingham" had been flung to the
breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid
$30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of
"Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of
contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly
hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.
Which is all very good.  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with
the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat
walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and
she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every
penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only
$1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent
planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and
sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of
being owned by Jim.  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room.
Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile
person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal
strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender,
had mastered the art.  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before
the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour
within twenty seconds.  Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its
full length.  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in
which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his
father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of
Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang
out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and
gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in
the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to
see him pluck at his beard from envy.  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about
her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again
nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a
tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  On went her old brown jacket; on
went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle
still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the
street.  Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large,
too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie." "Will you buy my hair?" asked
Della.  "I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at
the looks of it." Down rippled the brown cascade.  "Twenty dollars," said
Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  "Give it to me quick" said
Della.  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed
metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  She found it at
last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like
it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a
platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value
by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things
should do. It was even worthy of The Watch.  As soon as she saw it she knew
that it must be Jim's. It was like him.  Quietness and value--the description
applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried
home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly
anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes
looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in
place of a chain.  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and
went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is
always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  Within forty minutes
her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look
wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror
long, carefully, and critically.  "If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to
herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney
Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and
eighty-seven cents?" At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  Jim was never late.
Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near
the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down
on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of
saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she
whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty." The door opened and
Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he
was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family!  He needed a new
overcoat and he was with out gloves.  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable
as a setter at the scent of quail.  His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there
was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was
not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments
that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that
peculiar expression on his face.  Della wriggled off the table and went for
him.  "Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut
off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving
you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do
it.  My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be
happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for
you." "You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not
arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  "Cut it
off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow?  I'm me
without my hair, ain't I?" Jim looked about the room curiously.  "You say your
hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  "You needn't look for
it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas
Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever
count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?" Out of his trance Jim
seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard
with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction.
Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A
mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought
valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be
illuminated later on.  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it
upon the table.  "Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't
think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that
could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may
see why you had me going a while at first." White fingers and nimble tore at
the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a
quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the
immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  For
there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped
for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with
jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were
expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over
them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the
tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  But she
hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes
and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!" And then Della leaped up
like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!" Jim had not yet seen his
beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull
precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.  "Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have
to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to
see how it looks on it." Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and
put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  "Dell," said he, "let's
put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while.  They're too nice to use
just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now
suppose you put the chops on." The magi, as you know, were wise
men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They
invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no
doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of
two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the
greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who
give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.
They are the magi.

Quote = Most terribly cold it was; it snowed,
and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this
cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded,
and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but
what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had
hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she
scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by
dreadfully fast.  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid
hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally
for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the
little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue
from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a
bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole
livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.  She crept along
trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little
thing!  The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful
curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From
all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast
goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.  In a
corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she
seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close
up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture,
for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from
her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for
above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though
the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.  Her little hands were
almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if
she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall,
and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it
burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over
it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though
she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a
brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed
so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm
them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the
remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.  She rubbed another against the
wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall
became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the
table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain
service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple
and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose
hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its
breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and
nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another
match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it
was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through
the glass door in the rich merchant's house.  Thousands of lights were burning
on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the
shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands
towards them when--the match went out.  The lights of the Christmas tree rose
higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and
formed a long trail of fire.  "Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for
her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no
more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.  She drew
another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there
stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an
expression of love.  "Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with
you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like
the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she
rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to
be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a
brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the
grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her
arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then
above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.  But in
the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and
with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last
evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches,
of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said.
No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no
one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered
on the joys of a new year.

Quote = A Child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one shoulder against a
high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, the while kicking carelessly
at the gravel.  Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised
yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved
with indistinctness through it. The child stood dreamily gazing.  After a time,
a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. A
short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it
and stumbled.  He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other.
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with
his tail. The child put out his hand and called him. In an apologetic manner
the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and
waggles. The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview,
until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon
the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.  This thing
seemed to overpower and astonish the little dark-brown dog, and wounded him to
the heart. He sank down in despair at the child's feet. When the blow was
repeated, together with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over
upon his back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with
his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  He looked so comical on his
back, and holding his paws peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and
gave him little taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog
took this chastisement in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he
had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his
repentance in every way that was in his power. He pleaded with the child and
petitioned him, and offered more prayers.  At last the child grew weary of this
amusement and turned toward home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on
his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.  Presently he struggled
to his feet and started after the child. The latter wandered in a perfunctory
way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. During
one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following
him with the air of a footpad.  The child beat his pursuer with a small stick
he had found. The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and
resumed his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.  On
the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, proclaiming
with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, with
no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized
and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the
child. His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.  When the
child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in
the rear. He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child
that he forgot the dragging rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.  The
child attempts to drag the dark brown dog The child sat down on the step and
the two had another interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to
please the child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child
suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift, avaricious charge and
seized the rope.  He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways
in a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very
skillfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft, and at last the
pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became
panic-stricken. In his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown. His
eyes grew wild with the terror of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically
and to brace his legs.  The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on
the stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his
purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the
door of his home, and finally with triumph across the threshold.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  No one was in.  The child
sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly
accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they
were firm and abiding comrades.  When the child's family appeared, they made a
great row. The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was
leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and drooped
like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor,
and, at the top of his voice, championed the dog. It happened that he was
roaring protestations, with his arms clasped about the dog's neck, when the
father of the family came in from work.  The parent demanded to know what the
blazes they were making the kid howl for.  It was explained in many words that
the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.  A
family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way
heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.  The
affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it appears, was in a
particularly savage temper that evening, and when he perceived that it would
amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, he decided that
it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off to a retired
part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce
rebellion of his wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the
household.  He and the child were associated together at all times save when
the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the large folk
kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent
objections. Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining
down his face and his arms outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been
struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father,
enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family
were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very
skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room containing a stove, a
table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display strategic ability of a high
order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. He could
force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to
use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was seldom
that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.  But when the
child was present, these scenes did not occur. It came to be recognized that if
the dog was molested, the child would burst into sobs, and as the child, when
started, was very riotous and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a
safeguard.  However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was
asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild,
wailful cry, a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering
and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At
these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with
a great variety of articles.  Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat
the dog, although it is not known that he ever had what could be truly called a
just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted
guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot
revenge. He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave
his friend the moment the child had finished, and was ready to caress the
child's hand with his little red tongue.  When misfortune came upon the child,
and his troubles overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay
his small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever sympathetic. It
is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the
unjust beatings his friend, when provoked, had administered to him.  He did not
achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family. He
had no confidence in them, and the fear that he would express at their casual
approach often exasperated them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain
satisfaction in underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to
watch the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often
successful in secret for himself.  So the dog prospered. He developed a large
bark, which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl
persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would utter little
yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when in his dreams he
encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully.  His devotion to
the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He wagged at his approach; he sank
down in despair at his departure. He could detect the sound of the child's step
among all the noises of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.
The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible
potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an
instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in the mystic, hidden fields of
his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith.
The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange
things in the vicinity. On these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully
along behind. Perhaps, though, he went ahead. This necessitated his turning
around every quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled
with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would carry himself
with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch.  One
day, however, the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk. He came
home and held carnival with the cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife.
He was in the midst of this recreation when the child, followed by the
dark-brown dog, entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.  He
was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The child's
practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He dived under the table,
where experience had taught him was a rather safe place. The dog, lacking skill
in such matters, was, of course, unaware of the true condition of affairs. He
looked with interested eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to
mean: Joyous gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was
the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The head of the
family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge howl of joy, and knocked the dog
down with a heavy coffee-pot. The dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and
fear, writhed to his feet and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a
ponderous foot. It caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide.  A second
blow of the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.  Here the child, uttering loud
cries, came valiantly forth like a knight. The father of the family paid no
attention to these calls of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog.
Upon being knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave
up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws in a
peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a
small prayer.  But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to
him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window. So he
reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg, lifted him, squirming, up. He
swung him two or three times hilariously about his head, and then flung him
with great accuracy through the window.  The soaring dog created a surprise in
the block. A woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary
shout and dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out
to watch the flight of the dog. A woman, who had been hanging out clothes in a
yard, began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with clothes-pins, but her
arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation.  In appearance she was like a gagged
prisoner. Children ran whooping.  The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the
roof of a shed five stories below.  From thence it rolled to the pavement of an
alleyway.  The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirgelike cry,
and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time to reach the
alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward, one step at a
time, and holding with both hands to the step above....they found him seated by
the body of his dark-brown friend.  When they came for him later, they found
him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend.

Quote = Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great
care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's
death.  It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled
hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was
there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when
intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name
leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of
its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful,
less tender friend in bearing the sad message.  She did not hear the story as
many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its
significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's
arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone.
She would have no one follow her.  There stood, facing the open window, a
comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical
exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could
see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver
with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the
street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which
someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering
in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through
the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her
window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite
motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child
who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young,
with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain
strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away
off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of
reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There
was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it?
She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it,
creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents,
the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She
was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and
she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white
slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered
word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the
breath: "free, free, free!" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had
followed it went from her eyes.  They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat
fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She
did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A
clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.
She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded
in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and
gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years
to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms
out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming
years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers
in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to
impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel
intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief
moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had
not. What did it matter!  What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in
the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as
the strongest impulse of her being!  "Free! Body and soul free!" she kept
whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the
keyhole, imploring for admission. "Louise, open the door! I beg; open the
door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake
open the door." "Go away. I am not making myself ill." No; she was drinking in
a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot
along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of
days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be
long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be
long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities.
There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly
like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they
descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone
was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered,
a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had
been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been
one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to
screen him from the view of his wife.  When the doctors came they said she had
died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.

Quote = One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in a
clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia. He lay at full
length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left
forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the
somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of
the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he might have been thought to be
dead. He was asleep at his post of duty. But if detected he would be dead
shortly afterward, death being the just and legal penalty of his crime.  The
clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road which
after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned sharply to the
west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards. There it turned
southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient
of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out northward, overlooking
the deep valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a
stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand
feet to the tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another
spur of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not
only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the entire
profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy to look.  A
Horseman in the Sky: Seneca Rocks North Fork Mountain, West VirginiaThe country
was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to the northward,
where there was a small natural meadow, through which flowed a stream scarcely
visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked hardly larger than an
ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more
vivid than that of the inclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant
cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of
the savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the
summit. The configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point
of observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered how
the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and whence came
and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow more than a
thousand feet below.  No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it
a theatre of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military
rat-trap, in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have
starved an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had
marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall they
would take to the road again, climb to the place where their unfaithful
sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the ridge fall upon a
camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to surprise it, for the
road led to the rear of it. In case of failure, their position would be
perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely would should accident or
vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.  The sleeping sentinel in the
clump of laurel was a young Virginian named Carter Druse. He was the son of
wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and
high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of
western Virginia. His home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One
morning he had risen from the breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely:
"Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it." The
father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in silence, and
replied: "Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you conceive to be your
duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we
both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter. Your
mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition; at
the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is
precious. It would be better not to disturb her." So Carter Druse, bowing
reverently to his father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy that
masked a breaking heart, left the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By
conscience and courage, by deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended
himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to
some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present
perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger
than resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a
dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a movement,
without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon,
some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his
consciousness--whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening
word which no human lips ever have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled.
He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking
stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of
his rifle.  His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal
pedestal, the cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and
sharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of impressive
dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and
soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in the marble which
limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume harmonized with its arial
background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by
the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine strikingly
foreshortened lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right
hand grasping it at the "grip"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was
invisible. In silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with
the sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the
confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away, showed
only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to the bottom of
the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldier's
testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the group appeared of
heroic, almost colossal, size.  For an instant Druse had a strange,
half-defined feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking
upon a noble work of art reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of
an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was
dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its
feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained
immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the
situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by
cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and
glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A
touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter Druse. At that
instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his
concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his
brave, compassionate heart.  Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an
enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and
comrades--an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its
numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw
the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising, falling, moving
unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his
weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he
lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from
intensity of emotion.  It was not for long; in another moment his face was
raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger
sought the trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason
sound. He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him
dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was plain: the
man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a moment's
spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken prayer, he must be
sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may have discovered
nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If
permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he
came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing
whether he knows. It may well be that his fixity of attention--Druse turned his
head and looked through the deeps of air downward, as from the surface to the
bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous
line of figures of men and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the
soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a
dozen summits!  Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again
upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights
of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they
were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: "Whatever
may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty." He was calm now. His teeth
were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping
babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until
suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered;
the spirit had said to the body: "Peace, be still." He fired.  An officer of
the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge had
left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and with aimless feet had made his way
to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff, was
considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration further. At a
distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone's throw, rose
from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a
height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a
sharp, rugged line against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile
against a background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant
hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base. Lifting
his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an astonishing
sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air!
Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in the
saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a
plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like a plume.
His hands were concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane. The animal's
body was as level as if every hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its
motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they
ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting
from a leap. But this was a flight!  Filled with amazement and terror by this
apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe
of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his
emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard
a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was
still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an
abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran
rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot;
thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In
the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by
the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it
did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly
downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of
the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man;
he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had
seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything
of advantage to the expedition he answered: "Yes, sir; there is no road leading
down into this valley from the southward." The commander, knowing better,
smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and
resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept
cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked
at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  "Did you fire?" the
sergeant whispered.  "Yes." "At what?" "A horse. It was standing on yonder
rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff."
The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having
answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not
understand.  "See here, Druse," he said, after a moment's silence, "it's no use
making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?"
"Yes." "Well?" "My father." The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away.
"Good God!" he said.

Quote = A very long time ago, in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling
like feathers from heaven, a beautiful queen sat sewing at her window, which
had a frame of black ebony. As she worked, she looked sometimes at the falling
snow, and it happened that she pricked her finger with her needle, so that
three drops of blood fell upon the snow. How pretty the red blood looked upon
the dazzling white! The queen said to herself as she looked it, Ah me! If only
I had a dear little child who had skin as white as the snow, lips as rosy as
the blood, and hair as black as the ebony window frame.  Soon afterwards she
had a little daughter, with skin white as snow, lips rosy as blood, and hair as
black as ebony  and she was therefore called Little Snow White.  But alas! When
the little one was born, the good queen died.  A year passed by, and the king
took another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she
could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a mirror
and when she stood in front of it and asked, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who
is the fairest of us all?  The mirror answered, Thou, O Queen, art the fairest
of all, and the queen was contented, because she knew the mirror could speak
nothing but the truth.  But as time passed on, Little Snow White grew more and
more beautiful. When she was seven years old, she was as lovely as the bright
day, and still more lovely than the queen herself, so that when the lady one
day asked her mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest of us
all?  It answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to
see.  The queen was shocked, and grew yellow and green with envy, and from that
moment envy and pride grew in her heart like rank weeds, so that she had no
peace day or night, until one day she called a huntsman and said, Take the
child away into the woods and kill her, for I can no longer bear the sight of
her. When you return, bring with you her heart, that I may know you have obeyed
my will.  The huntsman dared not disobey, and he led Snow White out into the
woods and placed an arrow in his bow to pierce her innocent heart, but the
little girl cried and begged him saying, Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I
will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.  And as she was
so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, Run away then, you poor
child. While to himself he thought, The wild beasts will soon have devoured
you, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since he no
longer had to kill her.  Then as a young wild boar came rushing by, he killed
it, took out its heart, and carried it home to the queen. The cook was ordered
to prepare this, and the wicked queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the
heart of Snow White.  Poor little Snow White was now all alone in the wild
wood, and so frightened was she that she trembled at every leaf that rustled.
Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the
wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm. She kept on running until she
came to a little house, where she went in to rest.  Inside the cottage,
everything she saw was tiny, but more dainty and clean than words can tell.
Upon a white-covered table stood seven little plates and upon each plate lay a
little spoon, besides which there were seven knives and forks and seven little
goblets. Against the wall, and side by side, stood seven little beds covered
with perfectly white sheets.  Snow White was so hungry and thirsty that she
took a little food from each of the seven plates, and drank a few drops of wine
from each goblet, for she did not wish to take everything away from one. Then,
because she was so tired, she crept into one of the beds, but it did not suit
her, and so she tried the others, but one was too long, another too short, and
so on - until she came to the seventh, which suited her exactly. She said her
prayers and soon fell fast asleep.  When night fell, the masters of the little
house came home. They were seven dwarfs, who worked with a pick axe and spade,
searching for copper and gold in the heart of the mountains.  They lit their
seven candles and then saw that someone had been to visit them.  The first
said, Who has been sitting on my chair?  The second said, Who has been eating
from my plate?  The third, Who has taken a piece of my bread?  The fourth, Who
has taken some of my vegetables?  The fifth, Who has been using my fork?  The
sixth, Who has been cutting with my knife?  The seventh, Who has been drinking
out of my goblet?  The first looked around and saw that his bed was rumpled, so
he said, Who has been getting into my bed?  Then the others looked round and
each one cried, Someone has been on my bed too!  But the seventh, when he
looked at his bed, saw little Snow White, who was lying asleep there. He called
the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and
brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow White.
Oh, heavens! Oh, heavens! Cried they. What a lovely child! They were so glad
that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh
dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the
night.  When the sun rose, Snow White awoke, and oh! How frightened she was
when she saw the seven little dwarfs. But they were very friendly, and asked
what her name was. My name is Snow White, she answered.  And how did you come
to get into our house? Asked the dwarfs.  Then she told them how her cruel
stepmother had intended her to be killed, but the huntsman had spared her life
and she had run on until she reached the little house. The dwarfs said, If you
will take care of our house; cook for us, make the beds, wash, mend, and knit,
and keep everything neat and clean, then you may stay with us and you shall
lack for nothing.  Yes, answered Snow White. With all my heart, and so she
stayed.  She kept the house neat and clean for the dwarfs, who went off early
in the morning to search for copper and gold in the mountains, and who expected
their meal to be standing ready for them when they returned at night.  All day
long Snow White was alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her to be careful
to let no one into the house. For, said they, your step mother will soon
discover that you are living here.  The queen, believing, of course, that Snow
White was dead, and that she had eaten her heart, and therefore she was again
the most beautiful lady in the land, went to her mirror, and said, Mirror,
mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  Then the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see.
Over the hills and far away, she dwells with seven dwarfs today.  How angry she
was, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth, and that the huntsman must
have deceived her. She thought and thought how she might kill Snow White, for
she knew she would have neither rest nor peace until she really was the most
beautiful in the land. At length she decided what to do. She painted her face
and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one could recognise
her, and in this disguise she climbed the seven mountains that lay between her
and the dwarfs house, and knocked at their door and cried, Pretty things to
sell, very cheap, very cheap.  Snow White peeped from the window and said, Good
day, good wife, and what are your wares?  All sorts of pretty things, my dear,
answered the woman. Silken laces of every colour, and she held up a brightly
coloured one, made of plaited silks.  Surely I might let this honest old woman
come in? Snow White thought, and unbolted the door and bought the pretty lace.
Dear, dear, what a sight for sore eyes you are, child, said the old woman.
Come, let me lace you properly for once.  Snow White had no suspicious
thoughts, so she placed herself in front of the old woman that she might fasten
her dress with the new silk lace. Immediately the wicked creature laced her
bodice so tightly that she could not breathe, and fell down upon the ground as
though she were dead. Now, said the queen, I am once more the most beautiful
lady in the land, and she went away.  When the dwarfs came home they were very
grieved to find their dear little Snow White lying upon the ground as though
she were dead. They lifted her gently and, seeing that she was too tightly
laced, cut the silken cord. She drew a long breath and then gradually came back
to life.  When the dwarfs heard all that had happened they said, The pedlar
woman was certainly the wicked queen. Now, take care in future that you open
the door to none when we are not with you.  The wicked queen had no sooner
reached home than she went to her mirror, and said, Mirror, mirror upon the
wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror answered as before, O
Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see. Over the hills
and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  The blood rushed to her face
as she heard these words, for she knew that Snow White must have come to life
again.  But I will manage to put an end to her yet, she said, and then by using
witchcraft, she made a poisonous comb.  Again she disguised herself, climbed
the seven mountains, and knocked at the door of the seven dwarfs cottage,
crying, Pretty things to sell - very cheap today!  Snow White looked out of the
window and said, Go away, good woman, for I dare not let you in.  "Surely you
can look at my goods," answered the woman, and held up the poisonous comb,
which pleased Snow White so well that she opened the door and bought it.  Come,
let me comb your hair in the newest way, said the woman, and the poor
unsuspicious child let her have her way, but no sooner did the comb touch her
hair than the poison began to work, and she fell fainting to the ground.
There, you model of beauty, said the wicked woman, as she went away. You are
done for at last!  Fortunately it was almost time for the dwarfs to come home,
and as soon as they came in and found Snow White lying upon the ground they
guessed that her wicked step mother had been there again, and set to work to
find out what was wrong.  They soon saw the poisonous comb, and drew it out of
her hair, and almost immediately Snow White began to recover, and told them
what had happened. Once more they warned her to be on her guard, and to open
the door to no one.  When the queen reached home, she went straight to the
mirror and said, Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?
The mirror answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far
to see. Over the hills and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  When
the queen heard these words she shook with rage. Snow White shall die, she
cried, even if it costs me my own life!  She went into a secret chamber, where
no one else ever entered, and there she made a poisonous apple. She then
painted her face and disguised herself as a peasant woman, and climbed the
seven mountains and went to the dwarfs house.  She knocked at the door. Snow
White put her head out of the window, and said, I must not let anyone in; the
seven dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.  Its all the same to me, answered the
peasant woman, I shall soon get rid of these fine apples. But before I go Ill
make you a present of one.  Oh! No, said Snow White, for I must not take it.
Surely you are not afraid of poison? Said the woman. See, I will cut one in
two; the rosy cheek you shall take, and the white cheek I will eat myself.
Now, the apple had been so cleverly made that only the rose-cheeked side
contained the poison. Snow White longed for the delicious-looking fruit, and
when she saw that the woman ate half of it, she thought there could be no
danger, and stretched out her hand and took the other part. But no sooner had
she tasted it than she fell down dead.  The wicked queen laughed aloud with joy
as she gazed at her. White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony, she said.
This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you.  She went straight home and asked her
mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  At
length it answered, Thou, O Queen, art fairest of all!  So her envious heart
had peace - at least, as much as an envious heart can have peace.  When the
little dwarfs came home at night they found Snow White lying upon the ground.
No breath came from her parted lips, for she was dead. They lifted her tenderly
and sought for some poisonous object which might have caused the mischief,
unlaced her frock, combed her hair, and washed her with wine and water, but all
in vain - dead she was and dead she remained. They laid her upon a bier, and
all seven of them sat round about it, and wept as though their hearts would
break, for three whole days.  When the time came that she should be laid in the
ground they could not bear to part from her. Her pretty cheeks were still rosy
red, and she looked just as though she were still living.  We cannot hide her
away in the dark earth, said the dwarfs, and so they made a transparent coffin
of shining glass, laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in letters of
gold; and that she was a kings daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the
mountain top, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.  And birds
came too and wept for Snow White; first an owl, then a raven, and at last a
dove.  For a long, long time little Snow White lay in the coffin, but she did
not change; she only looked as though she slept, for she was still as white as
snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony.  It chanced that a kings son came
into the wood, and went to the dwarfs house, meaning to spend the night there.
He saw the coffin upon the mountain top, with little Snow White lying within
it, and he read the words that were written upon it in letters of gold.  He
said to the dwarfs, If you will but let me have the coffin, you may ask of me
what you will, and I will give it to you.  But the dwarfs answered, We would
not sell it for all the gold in the world.  Then said the prince, Let me have
it as a gift, I pray you - for I cannot live without seeing little Snow White,
and I will prize your gift as the dearest of my possessions.  The good little
dwarfs pitied him when they heard these words, and so gave him the coffin. The
kings son then bade his servants place it upon their shoulders and carry it
away, but as they went they stumbled over the stump of a tree, and the violent
shaking shook the piece of poisonous apple which had lodged in Snow Whites
throat out again, so that she opened her eyes, raised the lid of the coffin,
and sat up, alive once more.  Where am I? She cried, and the happy prince
answered, Thou art with me, dearest.  Then he told her all that had happened,
and how he loved her better than the whole world, and begged her to go with him
to his fathers palace and be his wife. Snow White agreed and went with him, and
the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and magnificence.  Little Snow
Whites wicked step mother was invited to the feast, and when she had dressed
herself in her most beautiful clothes, she stood before her mirror, and said,
Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, The young queen is fairer to see.
Oh! How angry the wicked woman was then, and so terrified too, that she
scarcely knew what to do. At first she thought she would not go to the wedding
at all, but then she felt that she could not rest until she had seen the young
queen. No sooner did she enter the palace than she recognised little Snow
White, and could not move for terror.  Then a pair of red hot iron shoes was
brought into the room with tongs and set before her, and these she was forced
to put on and to dance in them until she could dance no longer, but fell down
dead, and that was the end of the wicked queen.

Quote = Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy. One
morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added
icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and
eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, "You
watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the
garden." So the old man and the old woman went out and began to dig potatoes,
and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he started to day dream, and
didnt watch it all of the time. All of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked
up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped a gingerbread man,
and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. The
little boy ran to shut the door, but the gingerbread man was too quick for him
and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road long before
the little boy could catch him.  The little boy ran after him as fast as he
could manage, crying out to his grandfather and grandmother, who heard the
noise, and threw down their spades in the garden to give chase too. The
gingerbread man outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while
they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two men digging a well who looked up
from their work and called out, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, and a little boy - and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well see about that?" Said they, and so they threw
down their picks and ran after him, but couldnt catch up with him, and soon
they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.  On ran the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to two men digging a ditch. "Where ye going, gingerbread
man?" said they.  He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
and two well diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well
see about that!" said they, and they too threw down their spades, and ran after
him. The gingerbread man soon outstripped them also, and seeing they could
never catch him, gave up the chase and sat down to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said, "Where are ye
going, gingerbread man?" He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a
little boy, two well diggers, and two ditch diggers, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Growled the bear. "Well see about that!" He
trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after the gingerbread man, who
never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind
that he saw he might as well given up the hunt at the start, so he stretched
himself out by the roadside to rest.  On went the gingerbread man and by-and-by
he came to a wolf. The wolf said, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch
diggers, and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Snarled
the wolf. "Well see about that!" So he set into a gallop after the gingerbread
man, who went on and on so fast, that the wolf too saw there was no hope of
overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest.  On went the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox
called out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, "Where ye going,
gingerbread man?" He said: "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" The fox said, "I cant quite hear you, gingerbread man. Wont you come
a little closer?" Turning his head a little to one side.  The gingerbread man
stopped his race for the first time, and went a little closer, and called out
in a very loud voice, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two
well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o." "I still cant quite hear you. Wont you come a little closer?" Said
the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards the gingerbread
man, and put one paw behind his ear.  The gingerbread man came up close, and
leaning towards the fox, screamed out "IVE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AN OLD WOMAN, A
LITTLE BOY, TWO WELL DIGGERS, TWO DITCH DIGGERS, A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN
OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!" "You can, can you?" Yelped the fox, and he snapped up the
gingerbread man in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.

Quote = A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of
it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.
She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called
Snow White and the other Rose Red, and they were the sweetest and best children
in the world: always hard working and cheerful. But Snow White was quieter and
more gentle than Rose Red. Rose Red loved to run about the fields and meadows,
and to pick flowers and catch butterflies. Snow White sat at home with her
mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no
work to do.  The two children loved each other so dearly that they always
walked about hand in hand, and when Snow White said, We will never desert each
other, Rose Red answered, No, not as long as we live, and the mother added,
Whatever one gets she shall share with the other. They often roamed about in
the woods gathering berries and no beast threatened to hurt them. In fact,
animals loved and trusted the two girls. The little hare would eat a cabbage
leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past
them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all
their might.  No evil ever befell them; if they stayed late in the wood and
night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept until
morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious
about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been
wakened by the morning sun, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white robe
sitting close to their resting place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly,
but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. When they looked around them they
realised that they had slept quite close to a deep crater in the ground. If
they had gone a few steps further in the darkness, they would have fallen into
it. When they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen
must have been the angel that guards good children.  Snow White and Rose Red
kept their mothers cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure
to go into it. In summer Rose Red looked after the house, and every morning
before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each
tree a rose. In winter Snow White lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was
made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the
evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said, Snow White, go and close
the shutters, and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her
spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat
and spun. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched
a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.  One evening as they
sat cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he wanted to come in.
The mother said, Rose Red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveller
seeking shelter. Rose Red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a
poor man standing in the darkness outside - but it was no such thing - only a
bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose Red screamed aloud
and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings,
and Snow White ran and hid behind her mothers bed. The bear began to speak, and
said, Dont be afraid. I wont hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm
myself a little.  My poor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only
take care you dont burn your fur. Then she called out, Snow White and Rose Red,
come out; the bear will do you no harm - he is a good, honest creature.  So
they both came out of their hiding places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew
near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat
the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him
until he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and
growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their
ease with him, and teased him and played with him quite roughly. They tugged
his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him
about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he
growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best
possible good nature, only when they went too far he cried, Oh! children, spare
my life!  Snow White and Rose Red, Do not beat your lover dead.  When it was
time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to
the bear, You can lie there on the hearth, in heavens name; it will be shelter
for you from the cold and wet.  As soon as day dawned the children led him out,
and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From this time on the bear came
every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children
play what pranks they liked with him. They got so used to him that the door was
never shut until their friend had made his appearance.  When spring came, and
all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow White, Now I must go
away, and not return again the whole summer.  Where are you going to, dear
bear? Snow White asked. I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the
wicked dwarfs. In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are forced to
remain underground, for they cant work their way through; but now, when the sun
has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy
the land and steal what they can. Anything that falls into their hands and into
their caves is not easily found again.  Snow White was quite sad that their
friend was leaving, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear stepping
out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow White thought she
saw glittering gold beneath it, but she couldnt be certain of it. The bear ran
hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.  A short time after this,
the mother sent the children into the wood to collect twigs to start the fire.
As they wandered, they came upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and
on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down,
but what it was they couldnt be certain. When they approached nearer they saw a
dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was
jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on
a chain, and didnt seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with
his fiery red eyes, and screamed out, What are you standing there for? Cant you
come and help me?  What were you doing, little man? asked Rose Red.  You
stupid, inquisitive goose! Replied the dwarf. I wanted to split the tree to get
little chips of wood for our kitchen fire. My beautiful white beard has gotten
caught in a cleft, so here I am stuck fast, and I cant get away; and you silly,
smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! What wretches you
are!  The children did all in their power, but they couldnt get the beard out -
it was wedged in far too firmly. I will run and fetch somebody, said Rose Red.
Crazy blockheads! Snapped the dwarf. Whats the good of calling anyone else?
Youre already two too many for me. Does nothing better occur to you than that?
Dont be so impatient, said Snow White, and taking her scissors out of her
pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free
he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree,
lifted it up, and muttered aloud, Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a
piece of my splendid beard! With these words he swung the bag over his back,
and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.  Shortly
after this Snow White and Rose Red were out again, walking along the bank of a
stream. They saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing
toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran forward and
recognised their old friend the dwarf.  Where are you going to? Rose Red asked.
Youre surely not going to jump into the water?  Im not such a fool, screamed
the dwarf. Dont you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?  The little
man had been sitting on the bank, fishing, when unfortunately the wind had
entangled his beard in the line. Immediately afterward a big fish bit, and the
feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out. The fish dragged the
dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every reed and blade of
grass.  The girls came up just in the nick of time, held him firm, and did all
they could to free his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in
a hopeless muddle. All they could do was to take out the scissors again to cut
the beard.  The little man was far from grateful to the girls for rescuing him.
He yelled to them, Do you call that manners, you toadstools, to disfigure a
fellows face?  It wasnt enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must
now cut off the best bit of it.  Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay
among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and
disappeared behind a stone.  It happened that soon after this the mother sent
the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their
road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.
While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly
above them, but always swooping lower, until at last it settled on a rock not
far from them.  Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They
ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old
friend, the dwarf, and was about to carry him off. The tender-hearted children
seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last
he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he
screamed in his screeching voice, Couldnt you have treated me more carefully?
You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds!  Then he took a bag of
precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were used
to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On
their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf
pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one
would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering
stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood
still and gazed on them.  What are you standing gaping there for? Screamed the
dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became scarlet with rage. He was about to go off
with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted
out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadnt time to
escape down his hole, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in
terror, Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! Ill give you all my treasure. Look at those
beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! What pleasure would you
get from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You wont feel me between your
teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel
for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heavens sake. But the bear,
paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with
his paw, and he never moved again. The girls had run away, but the bear called
after them, Snow White and Rose Red, dont be afraid. Wait, and Ill come with
you. Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was
quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood
beside them, all dressed in gold.  I am a kings son, he said, and have been
doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about
the woods as a wild bear until his death should set me free. Now he has got his
well-merited punishment.  In due course, when the girls were old enough, Snow
White married the prince who had been a bear, and Rose Red - his brother, and
they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between
them. The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she
carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and
every year they bore the finest red and white roses.

Quote = ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and
most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had been married before, and already
had two daughters who were exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by
his first wife, a young daughter, but of unequalled goodness and sweetness of
temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.
This sweet little girl missed her mother, who had died, terribly much No sooner
was the wedding ceremony over, than the new wife began to show herself in her
true colours. She could not bear the goodness of the gentlemans pretty girl,
and especially as she made her own daughters appear the more horrid. She made
her do the meanest jobs in the house. The girl scoured the dishes and tables,
and scrubbed the stepmothers bathroom, and those of her daughters. She slept in
a little attic, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay upon beds with
the softest pillows, in fine rooms, with floors covered with beautiful carpets,
and walls on which hung looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves
at their full length from head to foot.  The poor girl bore all patiently, and
dared not tell her father, who would have been angry with her; for his new wife
ruled him entirely. When the little girl had done her work, she used to go into
the chimney corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which led her to be
called Cinderwench; but the youngest stepdaughter, who was not quite so rude
and unkind as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, dressed
in rags was a hundred times prettier than her sisters, though they were always
dressed very richly.  It happened that the kings son gave a ball, and invited
all the finest gentlemen and ladies of the city. Our young misses were also
invited, for they were always to be seen at fashionable parties. They were
truly delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing such
gowns, petticoats, and headdresses as might suit them. This was a new trouble
to Cinderella, for it was she who washed and ironed her sisters clothes and got
all their things ready. Meanwhile, the sisters talked all day long of nothing
but what they should wear to the ball.  For my part, said the eldest, I will
wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.  And I, said the youngest, shall
have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my
gold-flowered gown, and my diamond belt, which is far from being the most
ordinary one in the world.  But in truth, they were still not absolutely sure
what would be best to wear to the ball, so they sent for the best fashion
designer they could find to advise on their evening dresses, and they had their
nails manicured at Mademoiselle de la Poche.  Cinderella was likewise called up
to them for advice, for she had excellent judgement, and advised them always
for the best, indeed, and offered her services to make up their hair, which
they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:
Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?  Alas! Said she. You only
jeer me. It is not for a poor girl like me to go there.  Youre quite right,
replied they, it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.
Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads all wrong, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly well.  The stepsisters were almost two
days without eating, so much were they thrilled and excited. They broke above a
dozen corsets in trying to be laced up tightly, so that they might have a fine
slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last the
happy day came. They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes
as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.
Just then, her fairy godmother, who used to watch over her secretly, saw her
all in tears, and appeared at her side and asked her what was the matter.  I
wish I could  I wish I could She was not able to speak the rest, being
interrupted by her tears and sobbing.  This fairy godmother of hers said to
her: You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?  Y-es, cried Cinderella,
with a great sigh.  Well, said her godmother, be but a good girl, and I will
see that you shall go to the ball. Then she took her into her secret room, and
said to her: Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.  Cinderella went
immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her
godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the
ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of the big vegetable, leaving
nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin
was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.  She then
went to look into her mousetrap, where she found six mice, all alive, and
ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor. As each mouse went out,
she gave it a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned
into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a
beautiful mouse-coloured dapple-grey. But they still needed a coachman.  I will
go and see, said Cinderella, if there is a rat in the rattrap  we may make a
coachman of him.  Youre a smart one, replied her godmother, go and look.
Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The
fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and having
touched him with her wand, was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the
smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.  After that, she said to her: Go again into
the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering can, bring them
to me.  She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six
footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their uniforms all
bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they
had done nothing else their whole lives. The fairy then said to Cinderella:
Well, you have here transport fit to take you to the ball. Are you not pleased
with it?  Oh yes, cried she, but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?
Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and at the same instant, her
clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This
done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.
Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all
things, commanded her not to stay until after midnight, telling her at the same
time that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again,
her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes
become just as they were before.  She promised her godmother she would not fail
to leave the ball before midnight; and then away she went, scarce able to
contain herself for joy. The kings son who was told that a great princess, whom
nobody knew, was to come, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she
alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.
There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the
violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular
beauty of the unknown newcomer.  Nothing was then heard but a confused noise
of: Ah! How lovely she is! Ah! How lovely she is!  The king himself, old as he
was, could not help watching her, and telling the queen softly that it was a
long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.  All the ladies
were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some
made the next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such
fine material and as able hands to make them.  The kings son led her to the
most honourable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him. She danced
so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine banquet was
served up, of which the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he
busied in gazing on her.  She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a
thousand polite gestures, giving them part of the oranges and lemon blossoms
which the prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for
they did not recognise her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she
heard the clock strike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately
made a curtsy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.  When she
got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and after having thanked her, she
said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because
the kings son had desired her.  As she was eagerly telling her godmother
whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which
Cinderella ran and opened.  How long you have stayed! Cried she, gaping,
rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just woken out of
her sleep. She had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they
went from home.  If you had been at the ball, said one of her sisters, you
would not have been tired. There came there the finest princess, the most
beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes. She was a thousand times nice to us,
and gave us orange and lemon blossoms.  Cinderella seemed very indifferent in
the matter, indeed, she asked them the name of that princess, but they told her
they did not know it, and that the kings son was very uneasy on her account and
would give all the world to know who she was.  At this Cinderella, smiling,
replied: She must then be very beautiful indeed. How happy you have been! Could
not I see her? Ah! Dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes
which you wear everyday.  Aye, to be sure! Cried Miss Charlotte. Lend my
clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you! I should be a fool.  Cinderella
indeed expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she
would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for
jokingly.  The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was
Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The kings son was
always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to
whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock
striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven. She then rose up
and fled, as nimble as a deer. The prince followed, but could not overtake her.
She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the prince took up most
carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes,
having nothing left of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to
that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen
a princess go out. They replied that they had seen nobody go out but a young
girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench
than a gentlewoman.  When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella
asked them if they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.
They told her yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve,
and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the
prettiest in the world, which the kings son had taken up; that he had done
nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he
was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.
What they said was very true, for a few days after the kings son commanded it
to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry the young woman
whose foot would perfectly fit the slipper. He sent out his most trusted
advisers from the palace, who began to try it upon the princesses, then the
duchesses and all the court, but in vain. It was then brought to the two
sisters, who each did all that she possibly could to thrust her foot into the
slipper, but neither sister could manage to do so. Cinderella, who saw all
this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing: Let me see if it will not
fit me.  Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to tease her. The
gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and
finding her very handsome, said it was only right that she should try, and that
he had orders to let every girl try.  He asked Cinderella to sit down, and
putting the slipper to her foot, found it went on very easily, and fitted her
as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was
excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of
her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her
godmother, who having touched with her wand Cinderellas clothes, made them
richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.  Now her two
sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the
ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill treatment
they had dished out to her. Cinderella took them up, and as she embraced them,
cried that she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love
her.  She was brought by carriage to the young prince, dressed as she was. He
thought her more charming than ever, and a few days after, married her.
Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters rooms in
the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the
court.

Quote = When I was a lad, my father used to send me out to the fields each day to watch
over his sheep. Hey now! There are worse jobs than sitting out in the fresh air
all day, but it was boring work for a lad. I longed to be running around with
my friends, playing ball, or making boyish mischief.  Cant the sheep look after
themselves? I asked my father. After all, they know how to bleat and munch
grass, but there isnt much else that they do.  Father said it was important
work, and most importantly of all, I must keep my eyes peeled for the wolf  in
case he came sneaking into the fields and grabbed one of the spring lambs.  I
couldnt even go to sleep. I had to sit and keep a sharp look out. After a few
weeks of this, I got so bored that I began to wish that the wolf would show up
and give me something to do.  Then I got thinking to myself: Lets liven things
up a bit, I thought. Lets play a trick on the villagers. So I got up and ran as
fast as I could into the village shouting at the top of my voice: Wolf! Wolf!
WOOOOOOOOLF!  The villagers grabbed sticks, rolling pins, and pitchforks and
came running up to the field to chase away the wolf.  But when they got there,
all was peaceful. The lambs were frolicking as usual, quite unmolested.  I
laughed: Ha ha! Fooled you all!  None of the villagers laughed with me. Some of
them grumbled and the blacksmith became quite angry and shouted at me  but he
was just a bad sport who couldnt see the funny side of my joke.  A week later I
did the same thing again, only this time I put on an even better act. I daubed
red paint on my arm, and pretended that the wolf had bitten me.  This fooled
even the blacksmith, who was on his guard after the last trick I had played.
When they all arrived breathless in the field, I again called out: Ha ha!
Fooled you!  This time, quite a few of the villagers were angry with me, and I
got quite an ear-wigging from the blacksmith, the teacher, and the iron-monger.
When I got home, my father was furious and told me that I had a stupid sense of
humour.  But I thought it was funny  and so did my friends.  About a week after
that, I was sitting up on the hill watching my fathers sheep as usual. It was
getting on for evening, and the sun was setting behind the forest. I would have
to spend the night out there, and oh, how lonely and bored was I. Then all of a
sudden the sheep dogs started to bark and the flock was running around and
bleating like they had all gone mad. Only they hadnt; there was a wolf among
the sheep and he had seized a lamb.  Wolf! Wolf! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF! I called
out and I ran into the village to get help.  But nobody came. Not one villager.
They carried on doing whatever they were doing. Eating supper, drinking ale, or
finishing off their work for the day.  Please, I said to the blacksmith. This
time its true. There really is a wolf.  But he just shrugged his shoulders.
You see nobody believes a liar, even when hes speaking the truth And thats why
you should never cry wolf unless you really mean it.

Quote = Mr. Fox was strolling through the woods when he noticed a plump hen sitting on
the branch of a tree.  Ah, he said to himself. Lunch. But he did not say that
aloud. No, he was far too cunning to show what he was really thinking. Instead,
he said, Good day to you, my lovely lady. May the angel of peace be upon you.
May your spirit be uplifted with joy.  Good day to you, clucked back the hen.
Have you strayed from the farmyard? enquired the fox.  I have, replied the hen.
I had to leave, you see. Cluck! Im afraid that the farmers wife is no honest
woman. She kept on stealing my eggs. Cl-uuuck!  One day, I noticed a hole in
the fence. I decided to pop through it, and make my own way in the world.
Cluck!  A hole in the fence, you say? asked Mr. Fox.  Cluck, indeed, said the
hen.  And Mr. Fox made a quiet note of that piece of information. However,
right then, he had more pressing business to attend to.  And how do you like
living on your own? he enquired. Do you not miss the warm bosom of friendship?
Cluck! On the whole, I enjoy my own company, she replied, but of course one has
to look out for tricky animals. Cluck! who would like to have me for their
lunch. Cluck! Cluck!  Have you for their lunch, you say? laughed Mr. Fox.
Darling, thats so last year! Havent you heard the news? We animals have seen
the light. We have surrendered to the Power of Love, and we have signed an
online Manifesto of Peace. Its gone viral, dont you know? Yes, the days of
eating one another are absolutely over. Meat is totally off the menu. And
nobody misses it, not one tiny, tender, tasty bit. The new in-diet is
vegetarianism. Why, even the owl has quit a life-long habit of eating mice, and
now lives on sunflower seeds.  She feels so much better for it. And ever since
the wolf found inner-tranquility through mindfulness and meditation, he has
realised that he just LOVES turnips for dinner. As for myself, Im rather
partial to a slither of red, succulent, raw beetroot. Indeed, we animals are on
a spiritual journey. We have learned that the only true things in this universe
are - Love, Peace and Friendship. Share the memes. Make Love not War! Practice
the Power of Now! Eat up your Veggies!  Cluck, said the hen. A Manifesto of
Peace, you say. Thats news to me.  Well, cluck on down, and Ill clue you in,
said Mr. Fox, trying not to lick his lips. You cant roast, I mean roost, up in
that tree until you are past your sell-by-date. What a waste! And what a girth!
Join me. We shall be best mates.  Let us walk in the woods, you and I, and talk
to the most spiritual and fascinating animals. They all know me, and have a
deep respect for my soul. Im so full of love. It just gushes out of me.  But
the hen said nothing. She uttered not one cluck. Instead, she stared silently
into the distance.  Come, come, said Mr Fox. The time to meditate is before
breakfast. Right now, well, its practically lunchtime.  Cluck, Im not
meditating, said the hen. Im looking out from my vantage point.  And what do
you know? Cl-uuck? I see a pack of hunting dogs, and theyre heading this way.
A pack of hunting dogs, you say, said Mr. Fox. Right-oh, thanks for the
tip-off. Ill make myself scarce.  Cluck cluck. Whats there to be frightened of?
Didnt you just say that Love and Peace have broken out amongst the animals?
Ill tell you more about that later, said Mr. Fox scampering off. The dogs
havent heard about it, yet. They're not on Facebook.  And with that, he was
gone. And so it seems that the hen wasnt so dim after all. She was right to be
wary of a sudden offer of friendship - and of people who are full of slick
slogans about love and peace, at least until they have shown that they practice
what they preach.  And Bertie says that you should be wary of charming
charlatans too.

Quote = It was summer in the land of Denmark, and though for most of the year
the country looks flat and ugly, it was beautiful now. The wheat was yellow,
the oats were green, the hay was dry and delicious to roll in, and from the old
ruined house which nobody lived in, down to the edge of the canal, was a forest
of prickly plants called burdocks so tall that a whole family of children might
have dwelt in them and never have been found out.  It was under these burdocks
that a duck had built herself a warm nest, and was not sitting all day on six
pretty eggs. Five of them were white, but the sixth, which was larger than the
others, was of an ugly grey colour. The duck was always puzzled about that egg,
and how it came to be so different from the rest. Other birds might have
thought that when the duck went down in the morning and evening to the water to
stretch her legs in a good swim, some lazy mother might have been on the
lookout , and have popped her egg into the nest. But ducks are not clever at
all, and are not quick at counting, so this duck did not worry herself about
the matter, but just took care that the big egg should be as warm as the rest.
This was the first set of eggs that the duck had ever laid, and, to begin with,
she was very pleased and proud, and laughed at the other mothers, who were
always neglecting their duties to gossip with each other or to take little
extra swims besides the two in the morning and evening that were necessary for
health. But at length she grew tired of sitting there all day. My eggs are
taking too long to hatch,' she said to herself; and she pined for a little
amusement also.  Still, she knew that if she left her eggs and the ducklings in
them to die, none of her friends would ever speak to her again; so there she
stayed, only getting off the eggs several times a day to see if the shells were
cracking--which may have been the very reason why they did not crack sooner.
She had looked at the eggs at least a hundred and fifty times, when, to her
joy, she saw a tiny crack on two of them, and scrambling back to the nest she
drew the eggs closer the one to the other, and never moved for the whole of
that day. Next morning she was rewarded by noticing cracks in the whole five
eggs, and by midday two little yellow heads were poking out from the shells.
This encouraged her so much that, after breaking the shells with her bill, so
that the little creatures could get free of them, she sat steadily for a whole
night upon the nest, and before the sun arose the five white eggs were empty,
and ten pairs of eyes were gazing out upon the green world.  Now the duck had
been carefully brought up, and did not like dirt, and, besides, broken shells
are not at all comfortable things to sit or walk upon; so she pushed the rest
out over the side, and felt delighted to have some company to talk to till the
big egg hatched. But day after day went on, and the big egg showed no signs of
cracking, and the duck grew more and more impatient, and began to wish she
could ask the advice of her husband, but he was never around when she needed
him.  'I can't think what is the matter with it,' the duck grumbled to her
neighbour who had called in to pay her a visit. 'Why I could have hatched two
broods in the time that this one has taken!' 'Let me look at it,' said the old
neighbour. 'Ah, I thought so; it is a turkey's egg. Once, when I was young,
they tricked me to sitting on a brood of turkey's eggs myself, and when they
were hatched the creatures were so stupid that nothing would make them learn to
swim. I have no patience when I think of it.' 'Well, I will give it another
chance,' sighed the duck, 'and if it does not come out of its shell in another
twenty-four hours, I will just leave it alone and teach the rest of them to
swim properly and to find their own food. I really can't be expected to do two
things at once.' And with a fluff of her feathers she pushed the egg into the
middle of the nest.  All through the next day she sat on, giving up even her
morning bath for fear that a blast of cold might strike the big egg. In the
evening, when she ventured to peep, she thought she saw a tiny crack in the
upper part of the shell. Filled with hope, she went back to her duties, though
she could hardly sleep all night for excitement. When she woke with the first
steaks of light she felt something stirring under her. Yes, there it was at
last; and as she moved, a big awkward bird tumbled head foremost on the ground.
There was no denying it was ugly, even the mother was forced to admit that to
herself, though she only said it was 'large' and 'strong.' 'You won't need any
teaching when you are once in the water,' she told him, with a glance of
surprise at the dull brown which covered his back, and at his long naked neck.
And indeed he did not, though he was not half so pretty to look at as the
little yellow balls that followed her.  When they returned they found the old
neighbour on the bank waiting for them to take them into the duckyard. 'No, it
is not a young turkey, certainly,' whispered she in confidence to the mother,
'for though it is lean and skinny, and has no colour to speak of, yet there is
something rather distinguished about it, and it holds its head up well.' 'It is
very kind of you to say so,' answered the mother, who by this time had some
secret doubts of its loveliness. 'Of course, when you see it by itself it is
all right, though it is different, somehow, from the others. But one cannot
expect all one's children to be beautiful!' By this time they had reached the
centre of the yard, where a very old duck was sitting, who was treated with
great respect by all the birds who lived on the water.  'You must go up and bow
low before her,' whispered the mother to her children, nodding her head in the
direction of the old lady, 'and keep your legs well apart, as you see me do. No
well-bred duckling turns in its toes. It is a sign of common parents.' The
little ducks tried hard to make their small fat bodies copy the movements of
their mother, and the old lady was quite pleased with them; but the rest of the
ducks looked on feeling annoyed, and one duck in particular said: 'Oh, dear me,
here are ever so many more little ducks! The yard is full already; and did you
ever see anything quite as ugly as that great tall creature? He is a disgrace
to any brood. I shall go and chase him out!' So saying she put up her feathers,
and running to the big duckling bit his neck.  The duckling gave a loud quack;
it was the first time he had felt any pain, and at the sound his mother turned
quickly.  'Leave him alone,' she said fiercely, 'or I will send for his father.
He was not bother you.' 'No; but he is so ugly and awkward no one can put up
with him,' answered the stranger. And though the duckling did not understand
the meaning of the words, he felt he was being blamed, and became more
uncomfortable still when the old Spanish duck who ruled the yard butted in: 'It
certainly is a great pity he is so different from these beautiful darlings. If
he could only be hatched over again!' The poor little fellow drooped his head,
and did not know where to look, but was comforted when his mother answered: 'He
may not be quite as handsome as the others, but he swims better, and is very
strong; I am sure he will make his way in the world as well as anybody.' 'Well,
you must feel quite at home here,' said the old duck waddling off. And so they
did, all except the duckling, who was snapped at by everyone when they thought
his mother was not looking. Even the turkey-cockerel, who was so big, never
passed him without mocking words, and his brothers and sisters, who would not
have noticed any difference unless it had been put into their heads, soon
became as rude and unkind as the rest.  At last he could bear it no longer, and
one day he fancied he saw signs of his mother turning against him too; so that
night, when the ducks and hens were still asleep, he stole away through an open
door, and under cover of the burdock leaves scrambled on by the bank of the
canal, till he reached a wide grassy moor, full of soft marshy places where the
reeds grew. Here he lay down, but he was too tired and too frightened to fall
asleep, and with the earliest peep of the sun the reeds began to rustle, and he
saw that he had blundered into a colony of wild ducks. But as he could not run
away again he stood up and bowed politely.  'You are ugly,' said the wild
ducks, when they had looked him well over; 'but, however, it is no business of
ours, unless you wish to marry one of our daughters, and that we should not
allow.' And the duckling answered that he had no idea of marrying anybody, and
wanted nothing but to be left alone after his long journey.  So for two whole
days he lay quietly among the reeds, eating such food as he could find, and
drinking the water of the moorland pool, till he felt himself quite strong
again. He wished he might stay were he was for ever, he was so comfortable and
happy, away from everyone, with nobody to bite him and tell him how ugly he
was.  He was thinking these thoughts, when two young geese caught sight of him
as they were having their evening splash among the reeds, looking for their
supper.  'We are getting tired of this moor,' they said, 'and to-morrow we
think of trying another, where the lakes are larger and the feeding better.
Will you come with us?' 'Is it nicer than this?' asked the duckling doubtfully.
And the words were hardly out of his mouth, when 'Pif! pah!' and the two new-
comers were stretched dead beside him.  At the sound of the gun the wild ducks
in the rushes flew into the air, and for a few minutes the firing continued as
the huntsmen aimed at the flying birds.  Luckily for himself the duckling could
not fly, and he floundered along through the water till he could hide himself
amidst some tall ferns which grew in a hollow. But before he got there he met a
huge creature on four legs, which soon realized was dog, who stood and gazed at
him with a long red tongue hanging out of his mouth. The duckling grew cold
with terror, and tried to hide his head beneath his little wings; but the dog
snuffed at him and passed on, and he was able to reach into his hiding place.
'I am too ugly even for a dog to eat,' said he to himself. 'Well, that is a
great mercy.' And he curled himself up in the soft grass till the shots died
away in the distance.  When all had been quiet for a long time, and there were
only stars to see him, he crept out and looked about him.  He would never go
near a pool again, never, thought he; and seeing that the moor stretched far
away in the opposite direction from which he had come, he marched bravely on
till he got to a small cottage, which seemed too tumbledown for the stones to
hold together many hours longer. Even the door only hung upon one hinge, and as
the only light in the room sprang from a tiny fire, the duckling edged himself
cautiously in, and lay down under a chair close to the broken door, from which
he could get out if necessary. But no one seemed to see him or smell him; so he
spend the rest of the night in peace.  Now in the cottage there lived an old
woman, her cat, and a hen; and it was really they, and not she, who were
masters of the house. The old woman, who passed all her days in spinning yarn,
which she sold at the nearest town, loved both the cat and the hen as her own
children, and never did anything they didnt want in any way; so it was them,
not her, that the duckling had to ask for a favour.  It was only next morning,
when it grew light, that they noticed their visitor, who stood trembling before
them, with his eye on the door ready to escape at any moment. They did not,
however, appear very fierce, and the duckling became less afraid as they
approached him.  'Can you lay eggs?' asked the hen. And the duckling answered
meekly: 'No; I don't know how.' Upon which the hen turned her back, and the cat
came forward.  'Can you ruffle your fur when you are angry, or purr when you
are pleased?' said she. And again the duckling had to admit that he could do
nothing but swim, which did not seem of much use to anybody.  So the cat and
the hen went straight off to the old woman, who was still in bed.  'Such a
useless creature has taken refuge here,' they said. 'It calls itself a
duckling; but it can neither lay eggs nor purr! What had we better do with it?'
'Keep it, to be sure!' replied the old woman briskly. 'It is all nonsense about
it not laying eggs. Anyway, we will let it stay here for a bit, and see what
happens.' So the duckling remained for three weeks, and shared the food of the
cat and the hen; but nothing in the way of eggs happened at all. Then the sun
came out, and the air grew soft, and the duckling grew tired of being in a hut,
and wanted with all his might to have a swim. And one morning he got so
restless that even his friends noticed it.  'What is the matter?' asked the
hen; and the duckling told her.  'I am so longing for the water again. You
can't think how delicious it is to put your head under the water and dive
straight to the bottom.' 'I don't think I should enjoy it,' replied the hen
doubtfully. 'And I don't think the cat would like it either.' And the cat, when
asked, agreed there was nothing she would hate so much.  'I can't stay here any
longer, I Must get to the water,' repeated the duck. And the cat and the hen,
who felt hurt and offended, answered shortly: 'Very well then, go.' The
duckling would have liked to say good- bye, and thank them for their kindness,
as he was polite by nature; but they had both turned their backs on him, so he
went out of the rickety door feeling rather sad. But, in spite of himself, he
could not help a thrill of joy when he was out in the air and water once more,
and cared little for the rude glances of the creatures he met. For a while he
was quite happy and content; but soon the winter came on, and snow began to
fall, and everything to grow very wet and uncomfortable. And the duckling soon
found that it is one thing to enjoy being in the water, and quite another to
like being damp on land.  The sun was setting one day, like a great scarlet
globe, and the river, to the duckling's vast bewilderment, was getting hard and
slippery, when he heard a sound of whirring wings, and high up in the air a
flock of swans were flying. They were as white as snow which had fallen during
the night, and their long necks with yellow bills were stretched to a land
where the sun shone all day. Oh, if he only could have gone with them! But that
was not possible, of course; and besides, what sort of companion could an ugly
thing like him be to those beautiful beings? So he walked sadly down to a
sheltered pool and dived to the very bottom, and tried to think it was the
greatest happiness he could dream of. But, all the same, he knew it wasn't!
And every morning it grew colder and colder, and the duckling had hard work to
keep himself warm. Indeed, it would be truer to say that he never was warm at
all; and at last, after one bitter night, his legs moved so slowly that the ice
crept closer and closer, and when the morning light broke he was caught fast,
as in a trap; and soon his senses went from him.  A few hours more and the poor
duckling's life had been ended. But, by good fortune, a man was crossing the
river on his way to his work, and saw in a moment what had happened. He had on
thick wooden shoes, and he went and stamped so hard on the ice that it broke,
and then he picked up the duckling and tucked him under his sheepskin coat,
where his frozen bones began to thaw a little.Instead of going on his work, the
man turned back and took the bird to his children, who gave him a warm mess to
eat and put him in a box by the fire, and when they came back from school he
was much more comfortable than he had been since he had left the old woman's
cottage.  They were kind little children, and wanted to play with him; but,
alas! the poor fellow had never played in his life, and thought they wanted to
tease him, and flew straight into the milk-pan, and then into the butter-dish,
and from that into the meal- barrel, and at last, terrified at the noise and
confusion, right out of the door, and hid himself in the snow amongst the
bushes at the back of the house.  He never could tell afterwards exactly how he
had spent the rest of the winter. He only knew that he was very miserable and
that he never had enough to eat. But by-and-by things grew better. The earth
became softer, the sun hotter, the birds sang, and the flowers once more
appeared in the grass. When he stood up, he felt different, somehow, from what
he had done before he fell asleep among the reeds to which he had wandered
after he had escaped from the peasant's hut. His body seemed larger, and his
wings stronger. Something pink looked at him from the side of a hill. He
thought he would fly towards it and see what it was.  Oh, how glorious it felt
to be rushing through the air, wheeling first one way and then the other! He
had never thought that flying could be like that! The duckling was almost sorry
when he drew near the pink cloud and found it was made up of apple blossoms
growing beside a cottage whose garden ran down to the banks of the canal. He
fluttered slowly to the ground and paused for a few minutes under a thicket of
syringas, and while he was gazing about him, there walked slowly past a flock
of the same beautiful birds he had seen so many months ago.  Fascinated, he
watched them one by one step into the canal, and float quietly upon the waters
as if they were part of them.  'I will follow them,' said the duckling to
himself; 'ugly though I am, I would rather be killed by them than suffer all I
have suffered from cold and hunger, and from the ducks and fowls who should
have treated me kindly.' And flying quickly down to the water, he swam after
them as fast as he could.  It did not take him long to reach them, for they had
stopped to rest in a green pool shaded by a tree whose branches swept the
water. And directly they saw him coming some of the younger ones swam out to
meet him with cries of welcome, which again the duckling hardly understood.  He
approached them glad, yet trembling, and turning to one of the older birds, who
by this time had left the shade of the tree, he said: 'If I am to die, I would
rather you should kill me. I don't know why I was ever hatched, for I am too
ugly to live.' And as he spoke, he bowed his head and looked down into the
water.  Reflected in the still pool he saw many white shapes, with long necks
and golden bills, and, without thinking, he looked for the dull grey body and
the awkward skinny neck. But no such thing was there.  Instead, he beheld
beneath him a beautiful white swan!  'The new one is the best of all,' said the
children when they came down to feed the swans with biscuit and cake before
going to bed. 'His feathers are whiter and his beak more golden than the rest.'
And when he heard that, the duckling thought that it was worth while having
undergone all the persecution and loneliness that he had passed through, as
otherwise he would never have known what it was to be really happy.

Quote = There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close
by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one
day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and
watching his line, all of a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the
water. When he reeled in his line, he pulled out a golden fish. But the fish
said, "Pray let me live! I am not a real fish. I am an enchanted prince. Put me
in the water again, and let me go!" "Oh, ho!" Said the man. "You need not go on
much more about the matter. I will have nothing to do with a fish that can
talk, so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!" Then he put him back into the
water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak
of blood behind him on the wave.  When the fisherman went home to his wife in
the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a golden fish, and how it had told
him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go
again. "Did not you ask it for anything?" Said the wife. "We live very
wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty. Do go back and tell the fish we
want a snug little cottage." The fisherman did not much like the business -
however, he went to the seashore, and when he got back there the water looked
all yellow and green. He stood at the waters edge, and said, "O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to
beg a gift of thee!" Then the fish came swimming to him and said, "Well, what
is her will? What does your wife want?" "Ah!" Said the fisherman. "She says
that when I caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let
you go. She does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug
little cottage." "Go home then," said the fish, "she is in the cottage
already!" So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice
trim little cottage.  "Come in, come in!" Said she. "Is not this much better
than the filthy pigsty we had?" There was a parlour, a bedroom, and a kitchen;
and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of
flowers and fruits. There was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman, "How happily we shall live now!" "We will try to do
so, at least," said his wife.  Everything went right for a week or two, and
then Dame Ilsabill said, "Husband, there is not nearly room enough for us in
this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small. I should
like to have a large stone castle to live in. Go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle." "Wife," said the fisherman, "I dont like to go to him
again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty
cottage to live in." "Nonsense!" Said the wife. "He will do it very willingly,
I know. Go along and try!" The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy:
and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very
calm. He went close to the edge of the waves, and said, "O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to
beg a gift of thee!" "Well, what does she want now?" said the fish.  "Ah!" Said
the man, dolefully. "My wife wants to live in a stone castle." "Go home then,"
said the fish, "she is standing at the gate of it already." So away went the
fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle.
"See," said she, "is not this grand?" With that they went into the castle
together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly
furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables. Behind the castle was a
garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, goats, hares,
and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow houses.  "Well," said the
man, "now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest
of our lives." "Perhaps we may," said the wife, "but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that." So they went to bed.The next morning when
Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with
her elbow, and said, "Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king
of all the land." "Wife, wife," said the man, "why should we wish to be the
king? I will not be king." "Then I will," said she. "But wife," said the
fisherman, "how can you be king? The fish cannot make you a king?" "Husband,"
said she, "say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king." So the man
went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This
time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves
and the ridges of foam as he cried out, "O man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My
wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"
"Well, what would she have now?" Said the fish. "Alas!" Said the poor man. "My
wife wants to be king." "Go home," said the fish, "she is king already." Then
the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of
soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. When he went in he saw his
wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her
head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than
the other.  "Well, wife," said the fisherman, "are you king?" "Yes," said she,
"I am king." And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, "Ah, wife!
what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to
wish for as long as we live." "I dont know how that may be," said she. "Never
is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I
think I should like to be emperor." "Alas, wife! Why should you wish to be
emperor?" Said the fisherman. "Husband," said she, "go to the fish! I say I
will be emperor." "Ah, wife!" Replied the fisherman. "The fish cannot make an
emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing." "I am
king," said Ilsabill, "and you are my slave - so go at once!" So the fisherman
was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good,
it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be
sorry for what we have done." He soon came to the seashore; and the water was
quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled
them about, but he went as near as he could to the waters brink, and said, "O
man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And
hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What would she have now?" Said the fish.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman, "she wants to be emperor." "Go home," said the fish,
"she is emperor already. "So he went home again, and as he came near he saw his
wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great
crown on her head a full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her
guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other - from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. Before her stood
princes, dukes, and earls. The fisherman went up to her and said, "Wife, are
you emperor?" "Yes," said she, "I am emperor." "Ah!" Said the man, as he gazed
upon her. "What a fine thing it is to be emperor!" "Husband," said she, "why
should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next." "O wife, wife!" Said he,
"How can you be pope? There is but one pope at a time in Christendom."
"Husband," said she, "I will be pope this very day." "But," replied the
husband, "the fish cannot make you pope." "What nonsense!" Said she. "If he can
make an emperor, he can make a pope - go and try him." So the fisherman went.
But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and
down in boiling waves. The ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the
tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of
blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising.
At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that
his knees knocked together. Still he went down near to the shore, and said, "O
man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And
hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What does she want now?" said the fish.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman. "My wife wants to be pope." "Go home," said the fish;
"she is pope already." Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting
on a throne that was two miles high. She had three great crowns on her head,
and around her stood all the pomp and power of the church. On each side of her
were two rows of burning lights of all sizes; the greatest as large as the
highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small
rush light. "Wife," said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness,
"are you pope?" "Yes," said she, "I am pope." "Well, wife," replied he, "it is
a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing
greater." "I will think about that," said the wife. Then they went to bed, but
Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next.
At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. "Ha!"
Thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window. "After all I
cannot prevent the sun rising." At this thought she was very angry, and wakened
her husband, and said, "Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of
the sun and moon." The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened
him so much that he started and fell out of bed. "Alas, wife! Cannot you be
easy with being pope?" "No," said she, "I am very uneasy as long as the sun and
moon rise without my permission. Go to the fish at once!" Then the man went
shivering with fear, and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm
arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. All the heavens became black
with stormy clouds, and the lightning played, and the thunders rolled. You
might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with
crowns of white foam upon their heads. The fisherman crept towards the sea, and
cried out, as well as he could, "O man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife
Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What
does she want now?" Said the fish. "Ah!" Said he. "She wants to be lord of the
sun and moon." "Go home," said the fish, "to your pigsty again." And there they
live to this very day.

Quote = A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn sacks to the
mill loyally for many a long year; but his strength was going, and he was
growing more and more unfit for work. His master began to wonder if it was
worth his while by keeping this old donkey much longer.  The donkey, seeing
that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to Bremen.
There, he thought, I can surely be town musician.  When he had walked some
distance, he found a dog lying on the road, gasping like one who had run until
he was tired. What are you gasping so for, you big fellow? Asked the donkey.
Ah, replied the dog, as I am old, and grow weaker daily; I can no longer hunt.
My master wanted to kill me, so I ran away, but now how am I to earn my bread?
Ill tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to Bremen, and shall be a town
musician there; come with me and work also as a musician. I will play the lute,
and you shall beat the kettledrum.  Old cat joins town musicians The dog
agreed, and so on they went. Not before long they came to a cat, sitting on the
path with a face like three rainy days!  Now then, old fluff and claws, what
has gone so wrong with you? Asked the donkey.  Who can be merry when his neck
is in danger? Answered the cat. Because I am now getting old, my teeth are worn
to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about
after mice. My mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away. Now good advice is
scarce. Where am I to go?  Go with us to Bremen. You understand night music so
you can be a town musician.  The cat thought well of it and decided to go with
them. After this the three runaways came to a farmyard, where the cockerel was
sitting upon the gate, cock-a-doodle-doing with all his might. Your
cock-a-doodle-do goes through and through my skull, said the donkey. What is
the matter?  Guests are coming on Sunday and the housewife has no pity, said
the cockerel, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup
tomorrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off. Now I am
cock-a-doodle-doing at full pitch while I can.  Ah you red-headed bird, said
the donkey, you had better come away with us. We are going to Bremen; you can
find something better than death everywhere. You have a good voice, and if we
make music together it must have some quality!  The cockerel agreed to this
plan, and all four went on together. They could not, however, reach the city of
Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to
pass the night. The donkey and the dog laid themselves down under a large tree,
the cat and cockerel settled themselves in the branches  but the cockerel flew
right to the top, where he was most safe.  Before he went to sleep, he called
out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a
light. The donkey said: If so, we had better get up and go on, for the shelter
here is bad. The dog thought that a few bones with some meat on would do him
good too!  So they moved further on, and soon saw the light shine brighter and
grow larger, until they came to a well lit robbers house. The donkey, as the
biggest, went to the window and looked in: What do you see, my grey horse?
Asked the cockerel. What do I see? Answered the donkey. A table covered with
good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.
That would be just the sort of thing for us, said the cockerel. Yes, yes. Ah,
how I wish we were there! Said the donkey.  Then the animals put their heads
together and schemed how to best win an invitation to come inside and join the
robbers at the table.  Come, come my friends, said the donkey. We are
musicians, so let us sing for our supper.  They began to perform their music
together: The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cockerel
cock-a-doodle-doed. Then they burst through the window into the room, so that
the glass clattered! At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no
otherwise than a ghost had come in, and they fled in a great fright out into
the forest. The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with
what was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month.  As soon as
the four musicians had done, they put out the light, and each found a sleeping
place according to his nature and to what suited him. The donkey laid himself
down upon some straw in the yard, the dog behind the door, the cat upon the
hearth near the warm ashes, and the cockerel perched himself upon a beam of the
roof; and being tired from their long walk, they soon went to sleep.  When it
was past midnight, the robbers saw from afar that the light was no longer
burning in their house. Appearing quiet, the captain said: We ought not to have
let ourselves be frightened out of our wits, and ordered one of them to go and
examine the house.  The messenger finding all was still, went into the kitchen
to light a candle, and taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for burning
coals, he held the candle to them to light it. The cat did not understand what
he meant to do, however, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching. He was
dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back door, but the dog, who lay there
sprang up and bit his leg. As he ran across the yard by the straw heap, the
donkey gave him a smart kick with its hind foot. The cockerel too, who had been
awakened by the noise, had become lively, and cried down from the beam,
Cock-a-doodle-doo!  Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain
and said: Ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who spat on me
and scratched my face with her long claws; and by the door stands a man with a
knife who stabbed me in the leg, and in the yard there lies a monster who beat
me with a wooden club. Above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who called out:
Bring the rogue here to me! So I got away as well as I could.  After this the
robbers did not trust themselves in the house again; but it suited the four
musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care to leave it anymore.

Quote = THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were
set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the
people. He devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers
trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants huts by fire, so
that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung
dried up on the singed black trees. Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in
her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the
soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served as new nourishment
to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse
things than these soldiers! The prince was of opinion that all this was right,
and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take. His power
increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his
deeds.  He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually
accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled. He erected
magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, and all who saw these splendid
buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly, What a mighty prince! But
they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor
did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the
destroyed cities.  The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his
magnificent buildings, and thought, like the crowd, What a mighty prince! But I
must have more  much more. No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed
it.  He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them. The conquered
kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through
the streets of his city. These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers feet
when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left. At last the
prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal
palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches - on the altars,
but in this the priests opposed him, saying, Prince, you are mighty indeed, but
Gods power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders.  Well,
said the prince. Then I will conquer God too. And in his haughtiness and
foolish presumption, he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with
which he could sail through the air. It was gorgeously fitted out and of many
colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but
each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and
had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all
directions, while the guns were at once loaded again. Hundreds of eagles were
attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards
the sun. The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and
woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green
meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it. At last
it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds. Higher and higher rose the eagles
up into the air, then God sent one of his numberless angels against the ship.
The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded
from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones. One drop of
blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angels wings and
fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burned into it, and weighed upon it
like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again.
The strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared around the princes
head, and the clouds around  were they formed by the smoke rising up from the
burned cities? Took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which
stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from
which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.  The prince
was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last with a terrible shock
into the branches of a large tree in the wood.  I will conquer God! Said the
prince. I have sworn it. My will must be done!  And he spent seven years in the
construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast
from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with. He gathered warriors
from all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they
covered the space of several miles. They entered the ships and the prince was
approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats one swarm of little gnats.
They buzzed around the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his
sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them,
that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him. The servants carried out
his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings,
crept into the princes ear and stung him. The place burned like fire, and the
poison entered into his blood. Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his
clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his
ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him: The mad prince, who wished to make
war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.

Quote = A soldier came marching along the high road--left, right! A left,
right! He had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side, for he had been
to the wars and was now returning home.  An old Witch met him on the road. She
was very ugly to look at: her bottom-lip hung down to her breast.  'Good
evening, Soldier!' she said. 'What a fine sword and knapsack you have! You are
the very picture of a fine soldier! You ought to have as much money as you can
carry!' 'Thank you, old Witch,' said the Soldier.  'Do you see that great tree
there?' said the Witch, pointing to a tree beside them. 'It is hollow within.
You must climb up to the top, and then you will see a hole through which you
can let yourself down into the tree. I will tie a rope round your waist, so
that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.' 'What shall I do down
there?' asked the Soldier.  'Get money!' answered the Witch. 'Listen! When you
reach the bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall; it is
light there, for there are more than three hundred lamps burning. Then you will
see three doors, which you can open--the keys are in the locks. If you go into
the first room, you will see a great chest in the middle of the floor with a
dog sitting upon it; he has eyes as large as saucers, but you needn't trouble
about him. I will give you my blue-check apron, which you must spread out on
the floor, and then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it; open
the chest and take as much money as you like. It is copper there. If you would
rather have silver, you must go into the next room, where there is a dog with
eyes as large as mill-wheels. But don't take any notice of him; just set him
upon my apron, and help yourself to the money. If you prefer gold, you can get
that too, if you go into the third room, and as much as you like to carry. But
the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the Round Tower at
Copenhagen! He is a savage dog, I can tell you; but you needn't be afraid of
him either. Only, put him on my apron and he won't touch you, and you can take
out of the chest as much gold as you like!' 'Come, this is not bad!' said the
Soldier. 'But what am I to give you, old Witch; for surely you are not going to
do this for nothing?' 'Yes, I am!' replied the Witch. 'Not a single farthing
will I take! For me you shall bring nothing but an old tinder-box which my
grandmother forgot last time she was down there.' 'Well, tie the rope round my
waist! 'said the Soldier.  'Here it is,' said the Witch, 'and here is my
blue-check apron.' Then the Soldier climbed up the tree, let himself down
through the hole, and found himself standing, as the Witch had said,
underground in the large hall, where the three hundred lamps were burning.
Well, he opened the first door. Ugh! there sat the dog with eyes as big as
saucers glaring at him.  'You are a fine fellow!' said the Soldier, and put him
on the Witch's apron, took as much copper as his pockets could hold; then he
shut the chest, put the dog on it again, and went into the second room. Sure
enough there sat the dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels.  'You had better
not look at me so hard!' said the Soldier. 'Your eyes will come out of their
sockets!' And then he set the dog on the apron. When he saw all the silver in
the chest, he threw away the copper he had taken, and filled his pockets and
knapsack with nothing but silver.  Then he went into the third room. Horrors!
the dog there had two eyes, each as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen,
spinning round in his head like wheels.  'Good evening!' said the Soldier and
saluted, for he had never seen a dog like this before. But when he had examined
him more closely, he thought to himself: 'Now then, I've had enough of this!'
and put him down on the floor, and opened the chest. Heavens! what a heap of
gold there was! With all that he could buy up the whole town, and all the sugar
pigs, all the tin soldiers, whips and rocking-horses in the whole world. Now he
threw away all the silver with which he had filled his pockets and knapsack,
and filled them with gold instead--yes, all his pockets, his knapsack, cap and
boots even, so that he could hardly walk. Now he was rich indeed. He put the
dog back upon the chest, shut the door, and then called up through the tree:
'Now pull me up again, old Witch!' 'Have you got the tinder-box also?' asked
the Witch.  'Botheration!' said the Soldier, 'I had clean forgotten it!' And
then he went back and fetched it.  The Witch pulled him up, and there he stood
again on the high road, with pockets, knapsack, cap and boots filled with gold.
'What do you want to do with the tinder-box?' asked the Soldier.  'That doesn't
matter to you,' replied the Witch. 'You have got your money, give me my
tinder-box.' 'We'll see!' said the Soldier. 'Tell me at once what you want to
do with it, or I will draw my sword, and cut off your head!' 'No!' screamed the
Witch.  The Soldier immediately cut off her head. That was the end of her! But
he tied up all his gold in her apron, slung it like a bundle over his shoulder,
put the tinder-box in his pocket, and set out towards the town.  It was a
splendid town! He turned into the finest inn, ordered the best chamber and his
favourite dinner; for now that he had so much money he was really rich.  It
certainly occurred to the servant who had to clean his boots that they were
astonishingly old boots for such a rich lord. But that was because he had not
yet bought new ones; next day he appeared in respectable boots and fine
clothes. Now, instead of a common soldier he had become a noble lord, and the
people told him about all the grand doings of the town and the King, and what a
beautiful Princess his daughter was.  'How can one get to see her?' asked the
Soldier.  'She is never to be seen at all!' they told him; 'she lives in a
great copper castle, surrounded by many walls and towers! No one except the
King may go in or out, for it is prophesied that she will marry a common
soldier, and the King cannot submit to that.' 'I should very much like to see
her,' thought the Soldier; but he could not get permission.  Now he lived very
gaily, went to the theatre, drove in the King's garden, and gave the poor a
great deal of money, which was very nice of him; he had experienced in former
times how hard it is not to have a farthing in the world. Now he was rich, wore
fine clothes, and made many friends, who all said that he was an excellent man,
a real nobleman. And the Soldier liked that. But as he was always spending
money, and never made any more, at last the day came when he had nothing left
but two shillings, and he had to leave the beautiful rooms in which he had been
living, and go into a little attic under the roof, and clean his own boots, and
mend them with a darning-needle. None of his friends came to visit him there,
for there were too many stairs to climb.  It was a dark evening, and he could
not even buy a light. But all at once it flashed across him that there was a
little end of tinder in the tinder-box, which he had taken from the hollow tree
into which the Witch had helped him down. He found the box with the tinder in
it; but just as he was kindling a light, and had struck a spark out of the
tinder-box, the door burst open, and the dog with eyes as large as saucers,
which he had seen down in the tree, stood before him and said: 'What does my
lord command?' 'What's the meaning of this?' exclaimed the Soldier. 'This is a
pretty kind of tinder-box, if I can get whatever I want like this. Get me
money!' he cried to the dog, and hey, presto! he was off and back again,
holding a great purse full of money in his mouth.  Now the Soldier knew what a
wonderful tinder-box this was. If he rubbed once, the dog that sat on the chest
of copper appeared; if he rubbed twice, there came the dog that watched over
the silver chest; and if he rubbed three times, the one that guarded the gold
appeared. Now, the Soldier went down again to his beautiful rooms, and appeared
once more in splendid clothes. All his friends immediately recognised him
again, and paid him great court.  One day he thought to himself: 'It is very
strange that no one can get to see the Princess. They all say she is very
pretty, but what's the use of that if she has to sit for ever in the great
copper castle with all the towers? Can I not manage to see her somehow? Where
is my tinder-box?' and so he struck a spark, and, presto! there came the dog
with eyes as large as saucers.  'It is the middle of the night, I know,' said
the Soldier; 'but I should very much like to see the Princess for a moment.'
The dog was already outside the door, and before the Soldier could look round,
in he came with the Princess. She was lying asleep on the dog's back, and was
so beautiful that anyone could see she was a real Princess. The Soldier really
could not refrain from kissing her--he was such a thorough Soldier. Then the
dog ran back with the Princess. But when it was morning, and the King and Queen
were drinking tea, the Princess said that the night before she had had such a
strange dream about a dog and a Soldier: she had ridden on the dog's back, and
the Soldier had kissed her.  'That is certainly a fine story,' said the Queen.
But the next night one of the ladies-in-waiting was to watch at the Princess's
bed, to see if it was only a dream, or if it had actually happened.  The
Soldier had an overpowering longing to see the Princess again, and so the dog
came in the middle of the night and fetched her, running as fast as he could.
But the lady-in-waiting slipped on soft rubber shoes and followed them. When
she saw them disappear into a large house, she thought to herself: 'Now I know
where it is; 'and made a great cross on the door with a piece of chalk. Then
she went home and lay down, and the dog came back also, with the Princess. But
when he saw that a cross had been made on the door of the house where the
Soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk also, and made crosses on all the doors
in the town; and that was very clever, for now the lady-in-waiting could not
find the right house, as there were crosses on all the doors.  Early next
morning the King, Queen, ladies-in-waiting, and officers came out to see where
the Princess had been.  'There it is!' said the King, when he saw the first
door with a cross on it.  'No, there it is, my dear!' said the Queen, when she
likewise saw a door with a cross.  'But here is one, and there is another!'
they all exclaimed; wherever they looked there was a cross on the door. Then
they realised that the sign would not help them at all.  But the Queen was an
extremely clever woman, who could do a great deal more than just drive in a
coach. She took her great golden scissors, cut up a piece of silk, and made a
pretty little bag of it. This she filled with the grains of porridge oats, and
tied it round the Princess' neck; this done, she cut a little hole in the bag,
so that the grains would strew the whole road wherever the Princess went.  In
the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back and ran away with
her to the Soldier, who was very much in love with her, and would have liked to
have been a Prince, so that he might have had her for his wife.  The dog did
not notice how the grains were strewn right from the castle to the Soldier's
window, where he ran up the wall with the Princess.  In the morning the King
and the Queen saw plainly where their daughter had been, and they took the
Soldier and put him into prison.  There he sat. Oh, how dark and dull it was
there! And they told him: 'To-morrow you are to be hanged.' Hearing that did
not exactly cheer him, and he had left his tinder-box in the inn.  Next morning
he could see through the iron grating in front of his little window how the
people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the drums and
saw the soldiers marching; all the people were running to and fro. Just below
his window was a shoemaker's apprentice, with leather apron and shoes; he was
skipping along so merrily that one of his shoes flew off and fell against the
wall, just where the Soldier was sitting peeping through the iron grating.
'Oh, shoemaker's boy, you needn't be in such a hurry!' said the Soldier to him.
'There's nothing going on till I arrive. But if you will run back to the house
where I lived, and fetch me my tinder-box, I will give you four shillings. But
you must put your best foot foremost.' The shoemaker's boy was very willing to
earn four shillings, and fetched the tinder-box, gave it to the Soldier,
and--yes--now you shall hear.  Outside the town a great scaffold had been
erected, and all round were standing the soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of
people. The King and Queen were sitting on a magnificent throne opposite the
judges and the whole council.  The Soldier was already standing on the top of
the ladder; but when they wanted to put the rope round his neck, he said that
the fulfilment of one innocent request was always granted to a poor criminal
before he underwent his punishment. He would so much like to smoke a small pipe
of tobacco; it would be his last pipe in this world.  The King could not refuse
him this, and so he took out his tinder-box, and rubbed it once, twice, three
times. And lo, and behold I there stood all three dogs--the one with eyes as
large as saucers, the second with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third
with eyes each as large as the Round Tower of Copenhagen.  'Help me now, so
that I may not be hanged!' cried the Soldier. And thereupon the dogs fell upon
the judges and the whole council, seized some by the legs, others by the nose,
and threw them so high into the air that they fell and were smashed into
pieces.  'I won't stand this!' said the King; but the largest dog seized him
too, and the Queen as well, and threw them up after the others. This frightened
the soldiers, and all the people cried: 'Good Soldier, you shall be our King,
and marry the beautiful Princess!' Then they put the Soldier into the King's
coach, and the three dogs danced in front, crying 'Hurrah!' And the boys
whistled and the soldiers presented arms.  The Princess came out of the copper
castle, and became Queen; and that pleased her very much.  The wedding
festivities lasted for eight days, and the dogs sat at table and made eyes at
everyone.

quote = Once upon a time, there lived a woodcutter and his wife, who had three
sons. The eldest two were strong and tall, and their mother and father were
always telling them how handsome and clever they were  but the youngest son
was, to tell you the truth, just a bit simple in the head. He wasnt very tall,
and he wasnt very strong, and his family thought he was good for nothing. They
hardly ever called him by his real name, but instead they gave him a cruel
nickname. They called him Dummy, because they said he was stupid.  One day the
eldest son wanted to go to the forest to cut wood. The mother praised him for
being such a useful boy, and before he set out she gave him some of her best
fruit cake for his lunch, and a bottle of wine to wash it down. While the boy
was walking through the forest, he met a little grey old man who said to him:
Do give me a little piece of your cake and a swig of your wine. Im so terribly
hungry and thirsty.  And the eldest son replied: Be off with you, you filthy
old beggar.  The little grey old man went away, but not without taking his
revenge. He put a curse on the boy, so that when he started to cut a tree down,
his axe slipped and went into his leg. The boy limped home to his mother who
washed his wound and bandaged him.  The next day, the second eldest son went
out to the forest to cut wood. Before he set out, his mother praised him for
being such a useful boy, but especially asked him to be careful with the axe,
so as not to have a nasty accident like his brother. The boy promised not to be
careless, and his mother gave him some of her best sponge cake for his lunch,
and a bottle of wine to wash it down.  It happened that as the boy was walking
through the woods, he came across the same little grey old man. The man said to
him: Do please share your sponge cake and your wine with me, for I am so
terribly weak with hunger and thirst.  The boy said: Be off with you, you lazy
old scoundrel. If you want to eat, youd better work.  The little grey old man
went away, but not without taking his revenge. Not long after, when the boy was
cutting down a tree, his axe flew out of his hand and hit him on the head. He
crawled home to his mother who bandaged up his wound and asked him why he had
not kept his promise to be more careful.  For the rest of the week, the two
eldest sons were both lying in bed recovering from their wounds. The father
said to the third and youngest son: Get on your feet, you lazy Dummy. Why are
you sitting around doing nothing, when both brothers are hurt and unable to
work? Get out to the forest and cut some wood  if youre not too stupid to do
that.  The mother laughed at him and said: Its more than likely that Dummy will
cut his own head off  but it wont be much of a loss to anyone. Before he left
she gave him some cake that she had burned almost to a crust in the oven, and a
bottle of sour beer to wash it down.  As the youngest boy was going through the
woods, he met the same little grey old man who had crossed the path of his
brothers. The man said to him: Do please share some of your cake and beer with
me. I am so terribly hungry and thirsty, and I fear that if I dont have
something to eat and drink soon, I will surely die The young boy replied: Old
man, I will gladly share with you what I have  but the cake is burnt and the
beer is sour.  Never mind that, said the man. I am grateful for what you can
give me.  The boy and the little grey old man sat down and shared the cake and
the beer. After they had finished their lunch, the man said: Since you have a
good heart, and have shared what you have with me, I will give you a reward.
You see that old tree over there. Cut it down with your axe and you will find
something of value inside its hollow trunk.  So when the little grey old man
had left, the young boy, whose parents called him Dummy, took his axe and cut
down the hollow tree just as he had been told. Inside he found a goose  but
this was no ordinary bird, for its feathers were made of gold.  The boy
realised that he was in luck, and thought to himself: Why should I go home now
and suffer the insults of my parents and brothers? They will take this valuable
bird from me, and I shall have nothing. So the boy decided to run away from
home. He put the golden goose under his arm and set out for the town. Then he
went to the inn, intending to stay there. He stood at the bar and asked the
innkeeper if he would accept a golden feather as payment for his board and
lodgings. When the innkeeper saw the golden goose, he readily agreed.  After
the boy had gone to bed he said to his three daughters: That young boy whose
parents call Dummy is staying up in our guest room. But he cant be as simple in
the head as they say  for hes got a valuable bird with him  a goose with
feathers made of gold.  The eldest daughter thought to herself: Well fancy
that; feathers made of gold. Ill pluck one or maybe more of those for myself.
After the clock struck midnight, she sneaked into the boys room, and saw that
he was asleep with his arm around the golden goose. She crept up and tried to
pluck a feather, but the feather wouldnt budge, and when she tried to take her
hand away, she found that she was stuck to it. She couldnt move, and she
couldnt cry out for fear of waking the boy. She had to stay where she was  on
her knees by the bed, with her hand on the feather.  After the clock struck one
in the morning, the second sister came in the room, planning to take one
feather or more for herself. In the dark she didnt see her sister, but as soon
as she touched her back, she found that her hand was stuck fast to her, and she
had to stay where she was, not moving and not making a sound.  After the clock
struck two in the morning, the third sister came in. The other two shouted:
Stay back! But it was too late  she reached out hoping to steal a feather and
found that her hand was stuck to the middle sister.  The boy and the goose
slept soundly through all of this. In the morning the boy got up, paid his bill
with a golden feather, and left the inn with the goose under his arm. The
sisters had no choice but to follow on behind him. What a pretty procession
they made!  Along the way they met the bishop: What a sight! He exclaimed. Its
hardly right for three young women to follow a boy around like that!  As the
girls went past he tapped the youngest on the shoulder. In doing so he found
that he was stuck to her and had to follow.  Further up the road they met a
police sergeant. The bishop called out to him: Sergeant. Help me get free from
this young womans shoulder. Im stuck to her and people are bound to start all
kinds of gossip about it!  The police sergeant tried to pull the bishop free,
but in doing so he found that both his hands were stuck to his waist, and he
had to follow along with the procession.  At the top of the road they met the
mayor. Whats this town coming to? Cried the mayor. The bishop and the police
sergeant are following three young girls who are following a young boy; all
holding on to each other in a most unseemly fashion. Have they gone mad?  As he
spoke, he tried to pull the police sergeant and the bishop away  but in doing
so he found that he was stuck to both of them, and had to follow on.  The boy
led the little line of the townspeople along up the road, and at the top of the
hill they passed the Kings palace. Now the Kings daughter was very beautiful,
but she had the saddest face in the whole wide world. She had never laughed and
not once even smiled. The King was so troubled by the young princess
unhappiness, that he had made a special law: Whosoever could make her laugh and
smile would win her hand in marriage.  But the truth was that nothing very
funny ever happened inside the royal palace. All the Kings servants and
advisers were far too high and mighty to understand what would make a young
girl laugh  or indeed to allow anything amusing to happen at all.  As the boy,
known as Dummy, went past the palace, he still held the golden goose under his
arm; and he was followed by the innkeepers three daughters, the bishop, the
police sergeant, and the mayor. The princess looked out and saw the important
people in their uniforms being tugged along behind three girls and a boy with a
goose. She thought that it was the first thing she had seen in her life that
was truly funny. She burst out laughing and ran, still giggling, to her father
to tell him all about what she had seen. When the King looked out of his window
and saw the procession, he couldnt help laughing himself. He sent for his
guards and told them to bring the boy and his followers directly to him. When
the boy entered the Kings chamber, with the followers behind him; the mayor,
the bishop and the policeman all called out angrily that he should pay for his
crime with his head. The king, still laughing, said that on the contrary  he
would be rewarded with the hand in marriage of his daughter, the princess.  For
an entire week after that, the innkeepers three daughters, the bishop, the
policeman, and the mayor were all stuck to the golden goose and to one another.
While they were stuck, all the townspeople and the whole court laughed and
laughed at them. The boy whose family called him Dummy married the princess and
inherited the kingdom. He lived with his beautiful wife and they had six happy
smiling children, and the palace was often filled with laughter.

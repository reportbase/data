quote = HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy
Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had
two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was
very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of
the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic
tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think
him unpractical, which he really was not.  Why cant you be like the Happy
Prince? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.
The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.  I am glad there is some
one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at
the wonderful statue.  He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children
as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their
clean white pinafores.  How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have
never seen one.  Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His
friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for
he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  Shall I
love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the
Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water
with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it
lasted all through the summer.  It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the
other Swallows, she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the
river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. She has
no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind. And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed
made the most graceful curtsies. I admit that she is domestic, he continued,
but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.  You have been trifling with me, he
cried, I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye! and he flew away.  All day long he
flew, and at night time he arrived at the city. Where shall I put up? he said;
I hope the town has made preparations.  Then he saw the statue on the tall
column. I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position with plenty of
fresh air. So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  I have a
golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared
to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop
of water fell on him. What a curious thing! he cried, there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.  Then another drop fell.  What
is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I must look for
a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened
his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.  Who are you? he said.  I am the Happy
Prince.  Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched
me.  When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a
very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed
I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am
dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all
the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose
but weep.  What, is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  Far away, continued the statue
in a low musical voice, far away in a little street there is a poor house. One
of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her
face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court
ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a
fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring
her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I
cannot move.  I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow. My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go
to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his
painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round
his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me
for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad.  I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow. Last summer, when I was
staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far
too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but
still, it was a mark of disrespect.  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that
the little Swallow was sorry. It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your messenger.  Thank you, little Swallow, said
the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the
cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by
the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the
balcony with her lover. How wonderful the stars are, he said to her, and how
wonderful is the power of love!  I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State ball, she answered; I have ordered passion flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.  At last he came to the poor house and
looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table
beside the womans thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys
forehead with his wings. How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting
better; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to
the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. It is curious, he remarked,
but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.  That is because you have
done a good action, said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and
then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew
down to the river and had a bath. What a remarkable phenomenon, said the
Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. A swallow in
winter! And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one
quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
Tonight I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the
prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed himself very much.  When
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. Have you any commissions for
Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said
the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  I am waited for in
Egypt, answered the Swallow. Tomorrow my friends will fly up to the Second
Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great
granite throne sits the god Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and
when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
At noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. They have eyes
like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the prince, far away across the city I
see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and
in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint.  I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who
really had a good heart. Shall I take him another ruby?  Alas! I have no ruby
now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one
of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play.  Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do
that; and he began to weep.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince,
do as I command you.  So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away
to the students garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his
head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered
violets.  I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great
admirer. Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.  The next day the
Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. Heave a-hoy!
they shouted as each chest came up. I am going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  I am
come to bid you good-bye, he cried.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the
Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  It is winter, answered the
Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the
green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must
leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.  In
the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little match-girl. She
has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father
will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has
no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and
give it to her, and her father will not beat her.  I will stay with you one
night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be
quite blind then.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I
command you.  So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran home,
laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. You are blind now, he
said, so I will stay with you always.  No, little Swallow, said the poor
Prince, you must go away to Egypt.  I will stay with you always, said the
Swallow, and he slept at the Princes feet.  All the next day he sat on the
Princes shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He
told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile,
and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world
itself and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands;
of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and
worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree,
and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.  Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.
There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and
tell me what you see there.  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting
at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving
children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep
themselves warm. How hungry we are! they said. You must not lie here, shouted
the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told
the Prince what he had seen.  I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you
must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf
of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the street. We have bread now! they cried.
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if
they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in
furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor
little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he
loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the bakers door where the baker
was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at
last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the
Princes shoulder once more. Good-bye, dear Prince! he murmured, will you let me
kiss your hand?  I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,
said the Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.  It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow. I
am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?  And
he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At
that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had
broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It
certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning the Mayor was
walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they
passed the column he looked up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy
Prince looks! he said.  How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who
always agreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.  The ruby has
fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said
the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!  Little better than a
beggar said the Town councillors.  And here is actually a dead bird at his
feet! continued the Mayor. We must really issue a proclamation that birds are
not to be allowed to die here. And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the
University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. We
must have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of
myself.  Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  What a strange thing!
said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. This broken lead heart will
not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away. So they threw it on a dust heap
where the dead Swallow was also lying.  Bring me the two most precious things
in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the
leaden heart and the dead bird.  You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of
gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.

Quote =  True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not
destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How,
then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you
the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain;
but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it
was this!  He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually
--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the
eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But
you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with
what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I
was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it
--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I
put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I
thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it
in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old
man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been
so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I
undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And
this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found
the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not
the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling
him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you
see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth
night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the
extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings
of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and
he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through
fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to
open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said
nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as
I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound
that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the
sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has
welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors
that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake
ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had
been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in
the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain;
because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him,
and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel
the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very
patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very,
very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how
stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of
the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It
was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it
with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that
chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely
upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness
is but over-acuteness of the sense?  --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that
sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my
fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even
yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern
motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and
quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the
night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this
excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a
neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on
with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed
and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon
the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone
dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will
think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the
concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the
legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly,
so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing
wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot
whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I
had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went
down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the
police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of
foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office,
and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,
--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was
my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took
my visitors all over the house.  I bade them search --search well. I led them,
at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In
the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired
them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed
the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued
and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but
it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise
was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more
fluently, and with a heightened voice.  Yet the sound increased --and what
could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch
makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers
heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily
increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent
gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could
I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been
sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and
continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men
chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!
--no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a
mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better
than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now
--again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!  louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked,
"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
the beating of his hideous heart!"

Quote = One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it
was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer
and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent
imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della
counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
Christmas.  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection
that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles
predominating.  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the
first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per
week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on
the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  In the vestibule below was a letter-box
into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal
finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the
name "Mr. James Dillingham Young." The "Dillingham" had been flung to the
breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid
$30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of
"Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of
contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly
hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.
Which is all very good.  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with
the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat
walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and
she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every
penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only
$1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent
planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and
sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of
being owned by Jim.  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room.
Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile
person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal
strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender,
had mastered the art.  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before
the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour
within twenty seconds.  Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its
full length.  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in
which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his
father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of
Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang
out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and
gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in
the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to
see him pluck at his beard from envy.  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about
her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again
nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a
tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  On went her old brown jacket; on
went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle
still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the
street.  Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large,
too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie." "Will you buy my hair?" asked
Della.  "I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at
the looks of it." Down rippled the brown cascade.  "Twenty dollars," said
Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  "Give it to me quick" said
Della.  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed
metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  She found it at
last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like
it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a
platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value
by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things
should do. It was even worthy of The Watch.  As soon as she saw it she knew
that it must be Jim's. It was like him.  Quietness and value--the description
applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried
home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly
anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes
looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in
place of a chain.  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and
went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is
always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  Within forty minutes
her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look
wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror
long, carefully, and critically.  "If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to
herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney
Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and
eighty-seven cents?" At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  Jim was never late.
Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near
the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down
on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of
saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she
whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty." The door opened and
Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he
was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family!  He needed a new
overcoat and he was with out gloves.  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable
as a setter at the scent of quail.  His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there
was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was
not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments
that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that
peculiar expression on his face.  Della wriggled off the table and went for
him.  "Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut
off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving
you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do
it.  My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be
happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for
you." "You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not
arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  "Cut it
off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow?  I'm me
without my hair, ain't I?" Jim looked about the room curiously.  "You say your
hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  "You needn't look for
it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas
Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever
count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?" Out of his trance Jim
seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard
with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction.
Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A
mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought
valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be
illuminated later on.  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it
upon the table.  "Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't
think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that
could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may
see why you had me going a while at first." White fingers and nimble tore at
the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a
quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the
immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  For
there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped
for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with
jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were
expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over
them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the
tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  But she
hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes
and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!" And then Della leaped up
like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!" Jim had not yet seen his
beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull
precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.  "Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have
to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to
see how it looks on it." Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and
put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  "Dell," said he, "let's
put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while.  They're too nice to use
just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now
suppose you put the chops on." The magi, as you know, were wise
men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They
invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no
doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of
two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the
greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who
give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.
They are the magi.

Quote = Most terribly cold it was; it snowed,
and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this
cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded,
and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but
what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had
hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she
scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by
dreadfully fast.  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid
hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally
for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the
little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue
from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a
bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole
livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.  She crept along
trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little
thing!  The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful
curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From
all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast
goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.  In a
corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she
seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close
up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture,
for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from
her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for
above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though
the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.  Her little hands were
almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if
she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall,
and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it
burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over
it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though
she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a
brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed
so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm
them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the
remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.  She rubbed another against the
wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall
became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the
table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain
service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple
and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose
hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its
breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and
nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another
match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it
was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through
the glass door in the rich merchant's house.  Thousands of lights were burning
on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the
shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands
towards them when--the match went out.  The lights of the Christmas tree rose
higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and
formed a long trail of fire.  "Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for
her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no
more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.  She drew
another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there
stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an
expression of love.  "Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with
you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like
the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she
rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to
be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a
brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the
grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her
arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then
above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.  But in
the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and
with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last
evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches,
of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said.
No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no
one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered
on the joys of a new year.

Quote = A Child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one shoulder against a
high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, the while kicking carelessly
at the gravel.  Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised
yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved
with indistinctness through it. The child stood dreamily gazing.  After a time,
a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. A
short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it
and stumbled.  He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other.
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with
his tail. The child put out his hand and called him. In an apologetic manner
the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and
waggles. The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview,
until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon
the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.  This thing
seemed to overpower and astonish the little dark-brown dog, and wounded him to
the heart. He sank down in despair at the child's feet. When the blow was
repeated, together with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over
upon his back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with
his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  He looked so comical on his
back, and holding his paws peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and
gave him little taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog
took this chastisement in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he
had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his
repentance in every way that was in his power. He pleaded with the child and
petitioned him, and offered more prayers.  At last the child grew weary of this
amusement and turned toward home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on
his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.  Presently he struggled
to his feet and started after the child. The latter wandered in a perfunctory
way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. During
one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following
him with the air of a footpad.  The child beat his pursuer with a small stick
he had found. The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and
resumed his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.  On
the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, proclaiming
with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, with
no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized
and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the
child. His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.  When the
child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in
the rear. He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child
that he forgot the dragging rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.  The
child attempts to drag the dark brown dog The child sat down on the step and
the two had another interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to
please the child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child
suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift, avaricious charge and
seized the rope.  He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways
in a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very
skillfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft, and at last the
pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became
panic-stricken. In his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown. His
eyes grew wild with the terror of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically
and to brace his legs.  The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on
the stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his
purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the
door of his home, and finally with triumph across the threshold.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  No one was in.  The child
sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly
accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they
were firm and abiding comrades.  When the child's family appeared, they made a
great row. The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was
leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and drooped
like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor,
and, at the top of his voice, championed the dog. It happened that he was
roaring protestations, with his arms clasped about the dog's neck, when the
father of the family came in from work.  The parent demanded to know what the
blazes they were making the kid howl for.  It was explained in many words that
the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.  A
family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way
heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.  The
affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it appears, was in a
particularly savage temper that evening, and when he perceived that it would
amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, he decided that
it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off to a retired
part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce
rebellion of his wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the
household.  He and the child were associated together at all times save when
the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the large folk
kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent
objections. Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining
down his face and his arms outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been
struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father,
enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family
were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very
skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room containing a stove, a
table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display strategic ability of a high
order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. He could
force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to
use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was seldom
that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.  But when the
child was present, these scenes did not occur. It came to be recognized that if
the dog was molested, the child would burst into sobs, and as the child, when
started, was very riotous and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a
safeguard.  However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was
asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild,
wailful cry, a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering
and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At
these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with
a great variety of articles.  Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat
the dog, although it is not known that he ever had what could be truly called a
just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted
guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot
revenge. He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave
his friend the moment the child had finished, and was ready to caress the
child's hand with his little red tongue.  When misfortune came upon the child,
and his troubles overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay
his small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever sympathetic. It
is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the
unjust beatings his friend, when provoked, had administered to him.  He did not
achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family. He
had no confidence in them, and the fear that he would express at their casual
approach often exasperated them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain
satisfaction in underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to
watch the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often
successful in secret for himself.  So the dog prospered. He developed a large
bark, which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl
persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would utter little
yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when in his dreams he
encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully.  His devotion to
the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He wagged at his approach; he sank
down in despair at his departure. He could detect the sound of the child's step
among all the noises of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.
The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible
potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an
instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in the mystic, hidden fields of
his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith.
The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange
things in the vicinity. On these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully
along behind. Perhaps, though, he went ahead. This necessitated his turning
around every quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled
with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would carry himself
with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch.  One
day, however, the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk. He came
home and held carnival with the cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife.
He was in the midst of this recreation when the child, followed by the
dark-brown dog, entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.  He
was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The child's
practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He dived under the table,
where experience had taught him was a rather safe place. The dog, lacking skill
in such matters, was, of course, unaware of the true condition of affairs. He
looked with interested eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to
mean: Joyous gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was
the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The head of the
family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge howl of joy, and knocked the dog
down with a heavy coffee-pot. The dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and
fear, writhed to his feet and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a
ponderous foot. It caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide.  A second
blow of the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.  Here the child, uttering loud
cries, came valiantly forth like a knight. The father of the family paid no
attention to these calls of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog.
Upon being knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave
up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws in a
peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a
small prayer.  But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to
him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window. So he
reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg, lifted him, squirming, up. He
swung him two or three times hilariously about his head, and then flung him
with great accuracy through the window.  The soaring dog created a surprise in
the block. A woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary
shout and dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out
to watch the flight of the dog. A woman, who had been hanging out clothes in a
yard, began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with clothes-pins, but her
arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation.  In appearance she was like a gagged
prisoner. Children ran whooping.  The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the
roof of a shed five stories below.  From thence it rolled to the pavement of an
alleyway.  The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirgelike cry,
and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time to reach the
alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward, one step at a
time, and holding with both hands to the step above....they found him seated by
the body of his dark-brown friend.  When they came for him later, they found
him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend.

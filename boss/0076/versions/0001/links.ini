quote = HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy
Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had
two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was
very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of
the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic
tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think
him unpractical, which he really was not.  Why cant you be like the Happy
Prince? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.
The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.  I am glad there is some
one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at
the wonderful statue.  He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children
as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their
clean white pinafores.  How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have
never seen one.  Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His
friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for
he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  Shall I
love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the
Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water
with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it
lasted all through the summer.  It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the
other Swallows, she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the
river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. She has
no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind. And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed
made the most graceful curtsies. I admit that she is domestic, he continued,
but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.  You have been trifling with me, he
cried, I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye! and he flew away.  All day long he
flew, and at night time he arrived at the city. Where shall I put up? he said;
I hope the town has made preparations.  Then he saw the statue on the tall
column. I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position with plenty of
fresh air. So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  I have a
golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared
to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop
of water fell on him. What a curious thing! he cried, there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.  Then another drop fell.  What
is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I must look for
a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened
his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.  Who are you? he said.  I am the Happy
Prince.  Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched
me.  When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a
very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed
I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am
dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all
the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose
but weep.  What, is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  Far away, continued the statue
in a low musical voice, far away in a little street there is a poor house. One
of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her
face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court
ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a
fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring
her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I
cannot move.  I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow. My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go
to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his
painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round
his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me
for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad.  I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow. Last summer, when I was
staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far
too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but
still, it was a mark of disrespect.  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that
the little Swallow was sorry. It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your messenger.  Thank you, little Swallow, said
the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the
cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by
the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the
balcony with her lover. How wonderful the stars are, he said to her, and how
wonderful is the power of love!  I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State ball, she answered; I have ordered passion flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.  At last he came to the poor house and
looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table
beside the womans thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys
forehead with his wings. How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting
better; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to
the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. It is curious, he remarked,
but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.  That is because you have
done a good action, said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and
then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew
down to the river and had a bath. What a remarkable phenomenon, said the
Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. A swallow in
winter! And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one
quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
Tonight I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the
prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed himself very much.  When
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. Have you any commissions for
Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said
the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  I am waited for in
Egypt, answered the Swallow. Tomorrow my friends will fly up to the Second
Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great
granite throne sits the god Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and
when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
At noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. They have eyes
like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the prince, far away across the city I
see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and
in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint.  I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who
really had a good heart. Shall I take him another ruby?  Alas! I have no ruby
now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one
of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play.  Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do
that; and he began to weep.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince,
do as I command you.  So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away
to the students garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his
head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered
violets.  I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great
admirer. Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.  The next day the
Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. Heave a-hoy!
they shouted as each chest came up. I am going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  I am
come to bid you good-bye, he cried.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the
Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  It is winter, answered the
Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the
green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must
leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.  In
the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little match-girl. She
has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father
will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has
no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and
give it to her, and her father will not beat her.  I will stay with you one
night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be
quite blind then.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I
command you.  So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran home,
laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. You are blind now, he
said, so I will stay with you always.  No, little Swallow, said the poor
Prince, you must go away to Egypt.  I will stay with you always, said the
Swallow, and he slept at the Princes feet.  All the next day he sat on the
Princes shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He
told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile,
and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world
itself and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands;
of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and
worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree,
and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.  Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.
There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and
tell me what you see there.  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting
at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving
children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep
themselves warm. How hungry we are! they said. You must not lie here, shouted
the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told
the Prince what he had seen.  I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you
must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf
of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the street. We have bread now! they cried.
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if
they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in
furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor
little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he
loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the bakers door where the baker
was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at
last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the
Princes shoulder once more. Good-bye, dear Prince! he murmured, will you let me
kiss your hand?  I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,
said the Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.  It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow. I
am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?  And
he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At
that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had
broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It
certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning the Mayor was
walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they
passed the column he looked up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy
Prince looks! he said.  How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who
always agreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.  The ruby has
fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said
the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!  Little better than a
beggar said the Town councillors.  And here is actually a dead bird at his
feet! continued the Mayor. We must really issue a proclamation that birds are
not to be allowed to die here. And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the
University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. We
must have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of
myself.  Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  What a strange thing!
said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. This broken lead heart will
not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away. So they threw it on a dust heap
where the dead Swallow was also lying.  Bring me the two most precious things
in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the
leaden heart and the dead bird.  You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of
gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.

Quote =  True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not
destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How,
then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you
the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain;
but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it
was this!  He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually
--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the
eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But
you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with
what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I
was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it
--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I
put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I
thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it
in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old
man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been
so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I
undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And
this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found
the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not
the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling
him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you
see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth
night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the
extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings
of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and
he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through
fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to
open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said
nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as
I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound
that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the
sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has
welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors
that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake
ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had
been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in
the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain;
because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him,
and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel
the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very
patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very,
very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how
stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of
the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It
was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it
with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that
chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely
upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness
is but over-acuteness of the sense?  --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that
sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my
fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even
yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern
motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and
quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the
night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this
excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a
neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on
with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed
and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon
the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone
dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will
think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the
concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the
legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly,
so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing
wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot
whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I
had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went
down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the
police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of
foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office,
and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,
--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was
my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took
my visitors all over the house.  I bade them search --search well. I led them,
at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In
the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired
them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed
the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued
and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but
it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise
was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more
fluently, and with a heightened voice.  Yet the sound increased --and what
could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch
makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers
heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily
increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent
gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could
I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been
sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and
continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men
chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!
--no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a
mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better
than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now
--again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!  louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked,
"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
the beating of his hideous heart!"

Quote = One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it
was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer
and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent
imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della
counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
Christmas.  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection
that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles
predominating.  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the
first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per
week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on
the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  In the vestibule below was a letter-box
into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal
finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the
name "Mr. James Dillingham Young." The "Dillingham" had been flung to the
breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid
$30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of
"Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of
contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly
hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.
Which is all very good.  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with
the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat
walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and
she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every
penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only
$1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent
planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and
sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of
being owned by Jim.  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room.
Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile
person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal
strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender,
had mastered the art.  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before
the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour
within twenty seconds.  Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its
full length.  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in
which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his
father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of
Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang
out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and
gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in
the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to
see him pluck at his beard from envy.  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about
her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again
nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a
tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  On went her old brown jacket; on
went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle
still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the
street.  Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large,
too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie." "Will you buy my hair?" asked
Della.  "I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at
the looks of it." Down rippled the brown cascade.  "Twenty dollars," said
Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  "Give it to me quick" said
Della.  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed
metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  She found it at
last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like
it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a
platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value
by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things
should do. It was even worthy of The Watch.  As soon as she saw it she knew
that it must be Jim's. It was like him.  Quietness and value--the description
applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried
home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly
anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes
looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in
place of a chain.  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and
went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is
always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  Within forty minutes
her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look
wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror
long, carefully, and critically.  "If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to
herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney
Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and
eighty-seven cents?" At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  Jim was never late.
Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near
the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down
on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of
saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she
whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty." The door opened and
Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he
was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family!  He needed a new
overcoat and he was with out gloves.  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable
as a setter at the scent of quail.  His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there
was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was
not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments
that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that
peculiar expression on his face.  Della wriggled off the table and went for
him.  "Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut
off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving
you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do
it.  My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be
happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for
you." "You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not
arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  "Cut it
off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow?  I'm me
without my hair, ain't I?" Jim looked about the room curiously.  "You say your
hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  "You needn't look for
it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas
Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever
count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?" Out of his trance Jim
seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard
with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction.
Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A
mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought
valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be
illuminated later on.  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it
upon the table.  "Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't
think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that
could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may
see why you had me going a while at first." White fingers and nimble tore at
the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a
quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the
immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  For
there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped
for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with
jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were
expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over
them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the
tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  But she
hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes
and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!" And then Della leaped up
like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!" Jim had not yet seen his
beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull
precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.  "Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have
to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to
see how it looks on it." Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and
put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  "Dell," said he, "let's
put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while.  They're too nice to use
just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now
suppose you put the chops on." The magi, as you know, were wise
men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They
invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no
doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of
two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the
greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who
give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.
They are the magi.

Quote = Most terribly cold it was; it snowed,
and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this
cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded,
and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but
what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had
hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she
scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by
dreadfully fast.  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid
hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally
for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the
little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue
from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a
bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole
livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.  She crept along
trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little
thing!  The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful
curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From
all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast
goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.  In a
corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she
seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close
up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture,
for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from
her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for
above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though
the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.  Her little hands were
almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if
she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall,
and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it
burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over
it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though
she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a
brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed
so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm
them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the
remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.  She rubbed another against the
wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall
became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the
table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain
service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple
and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose
hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its
breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and
nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another
match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it
was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through
the glass door in the rich merchant's house.  Thousands of lights were burning
on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the
shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands
towards them when--the match went out.  The lights of the Christmas tree rose
higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and
formed a long trail of fire.  "Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for
her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no
more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.  She drew
another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there
stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an
expression of love.  "Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with
you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like
the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she
rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to
be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a
brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the
grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her
arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then
above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.  But in
the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and
with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last
evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches,
of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said.
No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no
one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered
on the joys of a new year.

Quote = A Child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one shoulder against a
high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, the while kicking carelessly
at the gravel.  Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised
yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved
with indistinctness through it. The child stood dreamily gazing.  After a time,
a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. A
short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it
and stumbled.  He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other.
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with
his tail. The child put out his hand and called him. In an apologetic manner
the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and
waggles. The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview,
until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon
the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.  This thing
seemed to overpower and astonish the little dark-brown dog, and wounded him to
the heart. He sank down in despair at the child's feet. When the blow was
repeated, together with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over
upon his back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with
his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  He looked so comical on his
back, and holding his paws peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and
gave him little taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog
took this chastisement in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he
had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his
repentance in every way that was in his power. He pleaded with the child and
petitioned him, and offered more prayers.  At last the child grew weary of this
amusement and turned toward home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on
his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.  Presently he struggled
to his feet and started after the child. The latter wandered in a perfunctory
way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. During
one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following
him with the air of a footpad.  The child beat his pursuer with a small stick
he had found. The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and
resumed his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.  On
the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, proclaiming
with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, with
no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized
and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the
child. His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.  When the
child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in
the rear. He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child
that he forgot the dragging rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.  The
child attempts to drag the dark brown dog The child sat down on the step and
the two had another interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to
please the child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child
suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift, avaricious charge and
seized the rope.  He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways
in a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very
skillfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft, and at last the
pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became
panic-stricken. In his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown. His
eyes grew wild with the terror of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically
and to brace his legs.  The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on
the stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his
purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the
door of his home, and finally with triumph across the threshold.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  No one was in.  The child
sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly
accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they
were firm and abiding comrades.  When the child's family appeared, they made a
great row. The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was
leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and drooped
like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor,
and, at the top of his voice, championed the dog. It happened that he was
roaring protestations, with his arms clasped about the dog's neck, when the
father of the family came in from work.  The parent demanded to know what the
blazes they were making the kid howl for.  It was explained in many words that
the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.  A
family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way
heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.  The
affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it appears, was in a
particularly savage temper that evening, and when he perceived that it would
amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, he decided that
it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off to a retired
part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce
rebellion of his wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the
household.  He and the child were associated together at all times save when
the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the large folk
kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent
objections. Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining
down his face and his arms outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been
struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father,
enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family
were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very
skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room containing a stove, a
table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display strategic ability of a high
order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. He could
force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to
use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was seldom
that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.  But when the
child was present, these scenes did not occur. It came to be recognized that if
the dog was molested, the child would burst into sobs, and as the child, when
started, was very riotous and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a
safeguard.  However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was
asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild,
wailful cry, a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering
and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At
these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with
a great variety of articles.  Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat
the dog, although it is not known that he ever had what could be truly called a
just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted
guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot
revenge. He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave
his friend the moment the child had finished, and was ready to caress the
child's hand with his little red tongue.  When misfortune came upon the child,
and his troubles overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay
his small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever sympathetic. It
is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the
unjust beatings his friend, when provoked, had administered to him.  He did not
achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family. He
had no confidence in them, and the fear that he would express at their casual
approach often exasperated them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain
satisfaction in underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to
watch the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often
successful in secret for himself.  So the dog prospered. He developed a large
bark, which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl
persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would utter little
yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when in his dreams he
encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully.  His devotion to
the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He wagged at his approach; he sank
down in despair at his departure. He could detect the sound of the child's step
among all the noises of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.
The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible
potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an
instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in the mystic, hidden fields of
his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith.
The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange
things in the vicinity. On these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully
along behind. Perhaps, though, he went ahead. This necessitated his turning
around every quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled
with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would carry himself
with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch.  One
day, however, the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk. He came
home and held carnival with the cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife.
He was in the midst of this recreation when the child, followed by the
dark-brown dog, entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.  He
was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The child's
practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He dived under the table,
where experience had taught him was a rather safe place. The dog, lacking skill
in such matters, was, of course, unaware of the true condition of affairs. He
looked with interested eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to
mean: Joyous gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was
the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The head of the
family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge howl of joy, and knocked the dog
down with a heavy coffee-pot. The dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and
fear, writhed to his feet and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a
ponderous foot. It caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide.  A second
blow of the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.  Here the child, uttering loud
cries, came valiantly forth like a knight. The father of the family paid no
attention to these calls of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog.
Upon being knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave
up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws in a
peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a
small prayer.  But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to
him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window. So he
reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg, lifted him, squirming, up. He
swung him two or three times hilariously about his head, and then flung him
with great accuracy through the window.  The soaring dog created a surprise in
the block. A woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary
shout and dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out
to watch the flight of the dog. A woman, who had been hanging out clothes in a
yard, began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with clothes-pins, but her
arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation.  In appearance she was like a gagged
prisoner. Children ran whooping.  The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the
roof of a shed five stories below.  From thence it rolled to the pavement of an
alleyway.  The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirgelike cry,
and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time to reach the
alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward, one step at a
time, and holding with both hands to the step above....they found him seated by
the body of his dark-brown friend.  When they came for him later, they found
him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend.

Quote = Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great
care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's
death.  It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled
hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was
there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when
intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name
leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of
its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful,
less tender friend in bearing the sad message.  She did not hear the story as
many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its
significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's
arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone.
She would have no one follow her.  There stood, facing the open window, a
comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical
exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could
see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver
with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the
street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which
someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering
in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through
the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her
window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite
motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child
who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young,
with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain
strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away
off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of
reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There
was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it?
She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it,
creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents,
the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She
was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and
she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white
slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered
word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the
breath: "free, free, free!" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had
followed it went from her eyes.  They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat
fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She
did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A
clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.
She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded
in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and
gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years
to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms
out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming
years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers
in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to
impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel
intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief
moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had
not. What did it matter!  What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in
the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as
the strongest impulse of her being!  "Free! Body and soul free!" she kept
whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the
keyhole, imploring for admission. "Louise, open the door! I beg; open the
door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake
open the door." "Go away. I am not making myself ill." No; she was drinking in
a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot
along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of
days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be
long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be
long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities.
There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly
like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they
descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone
was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered,
a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had
been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been
one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to
screen him from the view of his wife.  When the doctors came they said she had
died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.

Quote = One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in a
clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia. He lay at full
length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left
forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the
somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of
the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he might have been thought to be
dead. He was asleep at his post of duty. But if detected he would be dead
shortly afterward, death being the just and legal penalty of his crime.  The
clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road which
after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned sharply to the
west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards. There it turned
southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient
of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out northward, overlooking
the deep valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a
stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand
feet to the tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another
spur of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not
only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the entire
profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy to look.  A
Horseman in the Sky: Seneca Rocks North Fork Mountain, West VirginiaThe country
was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to the northward,
where there was a small natural meadow, through which flowed a stream scarcely
visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked hardly larger than an
ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more
vivid than that of the inclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant
cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of
the savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the
summit. The configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point
of observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered how
the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and whence came
and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow more than a
thousand feet below.  No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it
a theatre of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military
rat-trap, in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have
starved an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had
marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall they
would take to the road again, climb to the place where their unfaithful
sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the ridge fall upon a
camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to surprise it, for the
road led to the rear of it. In case of failure, their position would be
perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely would should accident or
vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.  The sleeping sentinel in the
clump of laurel was a young Virginian named Carter Druse. He was the son of
wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and
high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of
western Virginia. His home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One
morning he had risen from the breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely:
"Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it." The
father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in silence, and
replied: "Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you conceive to be your
duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we
both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter. Your
mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition; at
the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is
precious. It would be better not to disturb her." So Carter Druse, bowing
reverently to his father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy that
masked a breaking heart, left the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By
conscience and courage, by deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended
himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to
some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present
perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger
than resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a
dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a movement,
without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon,
some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his
consciousness--whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening
word which no human lips ever have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled.
He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking
stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of
his rifle.  His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal
pedestal, the cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and
sharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of impressive
dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and
soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in the marble which
limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume harmonized with its arial
background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by
the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine strikingly
foreshortened lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right
hand grasping it at the "grip"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was
invisible. In silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with
the sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the
confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away, showed
only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to the bottom of
the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldier's
testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the group appeared of
heroic, almost colossal, size.  For an instant Druse had a strange,
half-defined feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking
upon a noble work of art reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of
an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was
dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its
feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained
immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the
situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by
cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and
glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A
touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter Druse. At that
instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his
concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his
brave, compassionate heart.  Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an
enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and
comrades--an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its
numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw
the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising, falling, moving
unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his
weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he
lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from
intensity of emotion.  It was not for long; in another moment his face was
raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger
sought the trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason
sound. He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him
dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was plain: the
man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a moment's
spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken prayer, he must be
sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may have discovered
nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If
permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he
came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing
whether he knows. It may well be that his fixity of attention--Druse turned his
head and looked through the deeps of air downward, as from the surface to the
bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous
line of figures of men and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the
soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a
dozen summits!  Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again
upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights
of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they
were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: "Whatever
may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty." He was calm now. His teeth
were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping
babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until
suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered;
the spirit had said to the body: "Peace, be still." He fired.  An officer of
the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge had
left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and with aimless feet had made his way
to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff, was
considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration further. At a
distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone's throw, rose
from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a
height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a
sharp, rugged line against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile
against a background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant
hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base. Lifting
his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an astonishing
sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air!
Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in the
saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a
plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like a plume.
His hands were concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane. The animal's
body was as level as if every hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its
motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they
ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting
from a leap. But this was a flight!  Filled with amazement and terror by this
apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe
of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his
emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard
a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was
still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an
abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran
rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot;
thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In
the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by
the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it
did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly
downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of
the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man;
he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had
seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything
of advantage to the expedition he answered: "Yes, sir; there is no road leading
down into this valley from the southward." The commander, knowing better,
smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and
resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept
cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked
at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  "Did you fire?" the
sergeant whispered.  "Yes." "At what?" "A horse. It was standing on yonder
rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff."
The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having
answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not
understand.  "See here, Druse," he said, after a moment's silence, "it's no use
making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?"
"Yes." "Well?" "My father." The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away.
"Good God!" he said.

Quote = A very long time ago, in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling
like feathers from heaven, a beautiful queen sat sewing at her window, which
had a frame of black ebony. As she worked, she looked sometimes at the falling
snow, and it happened that she pricked her finger with her needle, so that
three drops of blood fell upon the snow. How pretty the red blood looked upon
the dazzling white! The queen said to herself as she looked it, Ah me! If only
I had a dear little child who had skin as white as the snow, lips as rosy as
the blood, and hair as black as the ebony window frame.  Soon afterwards she
had a little daughter, with skin white as snow, lips rosy as blood, and hair as
black as ebony  and she was therefore called Little Snow White.  But alas! When
the little one was born, the good queen died.  A year passed by, and the king
took another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she
could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a mirror
and when she stood in front of it and asked, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who
is the fairest of us all?  The mirror answered, Thou, O Queen, art the fairest
of all, and the queen was contented, because she knew the mirror could speak
nothing but the truth.  But as time passed on, Little Snow White grew more and
more beautiful. When she was seven years old, she was as lovely as the bright
day, and still more lovely than the queen herself, so that when the lady one
day asked her mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest of us
all?  It answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to
see.  The queen was shocked, and grew yellow and green with envy, and from that
moment envy and pride grew in her heart like rank weeds, so that she had no
peace day or night, until one day she called a huntsman and said, Take the
child away into the woods and kill her, for I can no longer bear the sight of
her. When you return, bring with you her heart, that I may know you have obeyed
my will.  The huntsman dared not disobey, and he led Snow White out into the
woods and placed an arrow in his bow to pierce her innocent heart, but the
little girl cried and begged him saying, Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I
will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.  And as she was
so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, Run away then, you poor
child. While to himself he thought, The wild beasts will soon have devoured
you, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since he no
longer had to kill her.  Then as a young wild boar came rushing by, he killed
it, took out its heart, and carried it home to the queen. The cook was ordered
to prepare this, and the wicked queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the
heart of Snow White.  Poor little Snow White was now all alone in the wild
wood, and so frightened was she that she trembled at every leaf that rustled.
Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the
wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm. She kept on running until she
came to a little house, where she went in to rest.  Inside the cottage,
everything she saw was tiny, but more dainty and clean than words can tell.
Upon a white-covered table stood seven little plates and upon each plate lay a
little spoon, besides which there were seven knives and forks and seven little
goblets. Against the wall, and side by side, stood seven little beds covered
with perfectly white sheets.  Snow White was so hungry and thirsty that she
took a little food from each of the seven plates, and drank a few drops of wine
from each goblet, for she did not wish to take everything away from one. Then,
because she was so tired, she crept into one of the beds, but it did not suit
her, and so she tried the others, but one was too long, another too short, and
so on - until she came to the seventh, which suited her exactly. She said her
prayers and soon fell fast asleep.  When night fell, the masters of the little
house came home. They were seven dwarfs, who worked with a pick axe and spade,
searching for copper and gold in the heart of the mountains.  They lit their
seven candles and then saw that someone had been to visit them.  The first
said, Who has been sitting on my chair?  The second said, Who has been eating
from my plate?  The third, Who has taken a piece of my bread?  The fourth, Who
has taken some of my vegetables?  The fifth, Who has been using my fork?  The
sixth, Who has been cutting with my knife?  The seventh, Who has been drinking
out of my goblet?  The first looked around and saw that his bed was rumpled, so
he said, Who has been getting into my bed?  Then the others looked round and
each one cried, Someone has been on my bed too!  But the seventh, when he
looked at his bed, saw little Snow White, who was lying asleep there. He called
the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and
brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow White.
Oh, heavens! Oh, heavens! Cried they. What a lovely child! They were so glad
that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh
dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the
night.  When the sun rose, Snow White awoke, and oh! How frightened she was
when she saw the seven little dwarfs. But they were very friendly, and asked
what her name was. My name is Snow White, she answered.  And how did you come
to get into our house? Asked the dwarfs.  Then she told them how her cruel
stepmother had intended her to be killed, but the huntsman had spared her life
and she had run on until she reached the little house. The dwarfs said, If you
will take care of our house; cook for us, make the beds, wash, mend, and knit,
and keep everything neat and clean, then you may stay with us and you shall
lack for nothing.  Yes, answered Snow White. With all my heart, and so she
stayed.  She kept the house neat and clean for the dwarfs, who went off early
in the morning to search for copper and gold in the mountains, and who expected
their meal to be standing ready for them when they returned at night.  All day
long Snow White was alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her to be careful
to let no one into the house. For, said they, your step mother will soon
discover that you are living here.  The queen, believing, of course, that Snow
White was dead, and that she had eaten her heart, and therefore she was again
the most beautiful lady in the land, went to her mirror, and said, Mirror,
mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  Then the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see.
Over the hills and far away, she dwells with seven dwarfs today.  How angry she
was, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth, and that the huntsman must
have deceived her. She thought and thought how she might kill Snow White, for
she knew she would have neither rest nor peace until she really was the most
beautiful in the land. At length she decided what to do. She painted her face
and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one could recognise
her, and in this disguise she climbed the seven mountains that lay between her
and the dwarfs house, and knocked at their door and cried, Pretty things to
sell, very cheap, very cheap.  Snow White peeped from the window and said, Good
day, good wife, and what are your wares?  All sorts of pretty things, my dear,
answered the woman. Silken laces of every colour, and she held up a brightly
coloured one, made of plaited silks.  Surely I might let this honest old woman
come in? Snow White thought, and unbolted the door and bought the pretty lace.
Dear, dear, what a sight for sore eyes you are, child, said the old woman.
Come, let me lace you properly for once.  Snow White had no suspicious
thoughts, so she placed herself in front of the old woman that she might fasten
her dress with the new silk lace. Immediately the wicked creature laced her
bodice so tightly that she could not breathe, and fell down upon the ground as
though she were dead. Now, said the queen, I am once more the most beautiful
lady in the land, and she went away.  When the dwarfs came home they were very
grieved to find their dear little Snow White lying upon the ground as though
she were dead. They lifted her gently and, seeing that she was too tightly
laced, cut the silken cord. She drew a long breath and then gradually came back
to life.  When the dwarfs heard all that had happened they said, The pedlar
woman was certainly the wicked queen. Now, take care in future that you open
the door to none when we are not with you.  The wicked queen had no sooner
reached home than she went to her mirror, and said, Mirror, mirror upon the
wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror answered as before, O
Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see. Over the hills
and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  The blood rushed to her face
as she heard these words, for she knew that Snow White must have come to life
again.  But I will manage to put an end to her yet, she said, and then by using
witchcraft, she made a poisonous comb.  Again she disguised herself, climbed
the seven mountains, and knocked at the door of the seven dwarfs cottage,
crying, Pretty things to sell - very cheap today!  Snow White looked out of the
window and said, Go away, good woman, for I dare not let you in.  "Surely you
can look at my goods," answered the woman, and held up the poisonous comb,
which pleased Snow White so well that she opened the door and bought it.  Come,
let me comb your hair in the newest way, said the woman, and the poor
unsuspicious child let her have her way, but no sooner did the comb touch her
hair than the poison began to work, and she fell fainting to the ground.
There, you model of beauty, said the wicked woman, as she went away. You are
done for at last!  Fortunately it was almost time for the dwarfs to come home,
and as soon as they came in and found Snow White lying upon the ground they
guessed that her wicked step mother had been there again, and set to work to
find out what was wrong.  They soon saw the poisonous comb, and drew it out of
her hair, and almost immediately Snow White began to recover, and told them
what had happened. Once more they warned her to be on her guard, and to open
the door to no one.  When the queen reached home, she went straight to the
mirror and said, Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?
The mirror answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far
to see. Over the hills and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  When
the queen heard these words she shook with rage. Snow White shall die, she
cried, even if it costs me my own life!  She went into a secret chamber, where
no one else ever entered, and there she made a poisonous apple. She then
painted her face and disguised herself as a peasant woman, and climbed the
seven mountains and went to the dwarfs house.  She knocked at the door. Snow
White put her head out of the window, and said, I must not let anyone in; the
seven dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.  Its all the same to me, answered the
peasant woman, I shall soon get rid of these fine apples. But before I go Ill
make you a present of one.  Oh! No, said Snow White, for I must not take it.
Surely you are not afraid of poison? Said the woman. See, I will cut one in
two; the rosy cheek you shall take, and the white cheek I will eat myself.
Now, the apple had been so cleverly made that only the rose-cheeked side
contained the poison. Snow White longed for the delicious-looking fruit, and
when she saw that the woman ate half of it, she thought there could be no
danger, and stretched out her hand and took the other part. But no sooner had
she tasted it than she fell down dead.  The wicked queen laughed aloud with joy
as she gazed at her. White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony, she said.
This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you.  She went straight home and asked her
mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  At
length it answered, Thou, O Queen, art fairest of all!  So her envious heart
had peace - at least, as much as an envious heart can have peace.  When the
little dwarfs came home at night they found Snow White lying upon the ground.
No breath came from her parted lips, for she was dead. They lifted her tenderly
and sought for some poisonous object which might have caused the mischief,
unlaced her frock, combed her hair, and washed her with wine and water, but all
in vain - dead she was and dead she remained. They laid her upon a bier, and
all seven of them sat round about it, and wept as though their hearts would
break, for three whole days.  When the time came that she should be laid in the
ground they could not bear to part from her. Her pretty cheeks were still rosy
red, and she looked just as though she were still living.  We cannot hide her
away in the dark earth, said the dwarfs, and so they made a transparent coffin
of shining glass, laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in letters of
gold; and that she was a kings daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the
mountain top, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.  And birds
came too and wept for Snow White; first an owl, then a raven, and at last a
dove.  For a long, long time little Snow White lay in the coffin, but she did
not change; she only looked as though she slept, for she was still as white as
snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony.  It chanced that a kings son came
into the wood, and went to the dwarfs house, meaning to spend the night there.
He saw the coffin upon the mountain top, with little Snow White lying within
it, and he read the words that were written upon it in letters of gold.  He
said to the dwarfs, If you will but let me have the coffin, you may ask of me
what you will, and I will give it to you.  But the dwarfs answered, We would
not sell it for all the gold in the world.  Then said the prince, Let me have
it as a gift, I pray you - for I cannot live without seeing little Snow White,
and I will prize your gift as the dearest of my possessions.  The good little
dwarfs pitied him when they heard these words, and so gave him the coffin. The
kings son then bade his servants place it upon their shoulders and carry it
away, but as they went they stumbled over the stump of a tree, and the violent
shaking shook the piece of poisonous apple which had lodged in Snow Whites
throat out again, so that she opened her eyes, raised the lid of the coffin,
and sat up, alive once more.  Where am I? She cried, and the happy prince
answered, Thou art with me, dearest.  Then he told her all that had happened,
and how he loved her better than the whole world, and begged her to go with him
to his fathers palace and be his wife. Snow White agreed and went with him, and
the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and magnificence.  Little Snow
Whites wicked step mother was invited to the feast, and when she had dressed
herself in her most beautiful clothes, she stood before her mirror, and said,
Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, The young queen is fairer to see.
Oh! How angry the wicked woman was then, and so terrified too, that she
scarcely knew what to do. At first she thought she would not go to the wedding
at all, but then she felt that she could not rest until she had seen the young
queen. No sooner did she enter the palace than she recognised little Snow
White, and could not move for terror.  Then a pair of red hot iron shoes was
brought into the room with tongs and set before her, and these she was forced
to put on and to dance in them until she could dance no longer, but fell down
dead, and that was the end of the wicked queen.

Quote = Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy. One
morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added
icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and
eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, "You
watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the
garden." So the old man and the old woman went out and began to dig potatoes,
and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he started to day dream, and
didnt watch it all of the time. All of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked
up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped a gingerbread man,
and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. The
little boy ran to shut the door, but the gingerbread man was too quick for him
and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road long before
the little boy could catch him.  The little boy ran after him as fast as he
could manage, crying out to his grandfather and grandmother, who heard the
noise, and threw down their spades in the garden to give chase too. The
gingerbread man outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while
they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two men digging a well who looked up
from their work and called out, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, and a little boy - and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well see about that?" Said they, and so they threw
down their picks and ran after him, but couldnt catch up with him, and soon
they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.  On ran the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to two men digging a ditch. "Where ye going, gingerbread
man?" said they.  He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
and two well diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well
see about that!" said they, and they too threw down their spades, and ran after
him. The gingerbread man soon outstripped them also, and seeing they could
never catch him, gave up the chase and sat down to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said, "Where are ye
going, gingerbread man?" He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a
little boy, two well diggers, and two ditch diggers, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Growled the bear. "Well see about that!" He
trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after the gingerbread man, who
never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind
that he saw he might as well given up the hunt at the start, so he stretched
himself out by the roadside to rest.  On went the gingerbread man and by-and-by
he came to a wolf. The wolf said, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch
diggers, and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Snarled
the wolf. "Well see about that!" So he set into a gallop after the gingerbread
man, who went on and on so fast, that the wolf too saw there was no hope of
overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest.  On went the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox
called out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, "Where ye going,
gingerbread man?" He said: "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" The fox said, "I cant quite hear you, gingerbread man. Wont you come
a little closer?" Turning his head a little to one side.  The gingerbread man
stopped his race for the first time, and went a little closer, and called out
in a very loud voice, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two
well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o." "I still cant quite hear you. Wont you come a little closer?" Said
the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards the gingerbread
man, and put one paw behind his ear.  The gingerbread man came up close, and
leaning towards the fox, screamed out "IVE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AN OLD WOMAN, A
LITTLE BOY, TWO WELL DIGGERS, TWO DITCH DIGGERS, A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN
OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!" "You can, can you?" Yelped the fox, and he snapped up the
gingerbread man in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.

Quote = A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of
it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.
She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called
Snow White and the other Rose Red, and they were the sweetest and best children
in the world: always hard working and cheerful. But Snow White was quieter and
more gentle than Rose Red. Rose Red loved to run about the fields and meadows,
and to pick flowers and catch butterflies. Snow White sat at home with her
mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no
work to do.  The two children loved each other so dearly that they always
walked about hand in hand, and when Snow White said, We will never desert each
other, Rose Red answered, No, not as long as we live, and the mother added,
Whatever one gets she shall share with the other. They often roamed about in
the woods gathering berries and no beast threatened to hurt them. In fact,
animals loved and trusted the two girls. The little hare would eat a cabbage
leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past
them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all
their might.  No evil ever befell them; if they stayed late in the wood and
night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept until
morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious
about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been
wakened by the morning sun, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white robe
sitting close to their resting place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly,
but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. When they looked around them they
realised that they had slept quite close to a deep crater in the ground. If
they had gone a few steps further in the darkness, they would have fallen into
it. When they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen
must have been the angel that guards good children.  Snow White and Rose Red
kept their mothers cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure
to go into it. In summer Rose Red looked after the house, and every morning
before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each
tree a rose. In winter Snow White lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was
made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the
evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said, Snow White, go and close
the shutters, and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her
spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat
and spun. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched
a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.  One evening as they
sat cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he wanted to come in.
The mother said, Rose Red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveller
seeking shelter. Rose Red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a
poor man standing in the darkness outside - but it was no such thing - only a
bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose Red screamed aloud
and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings,
and Snow White ran and hid behind her mothers bed. The bear began to speak, and
said, Dont be afraid. I wont hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm
myself a little.  My poor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only
take care you dont burn your fur. Then she called out, Snow White and Rose Red,
come out; the bear will do you no harm - he is a good, honest creature.  So
they both came out of their hiding places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew
near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat
the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him
until he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and
growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their
ease with him, and teased him and played with him quite roughly. They tugged
his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him
about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he
growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best
possible good nature, only when they went too far he cried, Oh! children, spare
my life!  Snow White and Rose Red, Do not beat your lover dead.  When it was
time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to
the bear, You can lie there on the hearth, in heavens name; it will be shelter
for you from the cold and wet.  As soon as day dawned the children led him out,
and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From this time on the bear came
every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children
play what pranks they liked with him. They got so used to him that the door was
never shut until their friend had made his appearance.  When spring came, and
all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow White, Now I must go
away, and not return again the whole summer.  Where are you going to, dear
bear? Snow White asked. I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the
wicked dwarfs. In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are forced to
remain underground, for they cant work their way through; but now, when the sun
has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy
the land and steal what they can. Anything that falls into their hands and into
their caves is not easily found again.  Snow White was quite sad that their
friend was leaving, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear stepping
out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow White thought she
saw glittering gold beneath it, but she couldnt be certain of it. The bear ran
hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.  A short time after this,
the mother sent the children into the wood to collect twigs to start the fire.
As they wandered, they came upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and
on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down,
but what it was they couldnt be certain. When they approached nearer they saw a
dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was
jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on
a chain, and didnt seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with
his fiery red eyes, and screamed out, What are you standing there for? Cant you
come and help me?  What were you doing, little man? asked Rose Red.  You
stupid, inquisitive goose! Replied the dwarf. I wanted to split the tree to get
little chips of wood for our kitchen fire. My beautiful white beard has gotten
caught in a cleft, so here I am stuck fast, and I cant get away; and you silly,
smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! What wretches you
are!  The children did all in their power, but they couldnt get the beard out -
it was wedged in far too firmly. I will run and fetch somebody, said Rose Red.
Crazy blockheads! Snapped the dwarf. Whats the good of calling anyone else?
Youre already two too many for me. Does nothing better occur to you than that?
Dont be so impatient, said Snow White, and taking her scissors out of her
pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free
he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree,
lifted it up, and muttered aloud, Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a
piece of my splendid beard! With these words he swung the bag over his back,
and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.  Shortly
after this Snow White and Rose Red were out again, walking along the bank of a
stream. They saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing
toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran forward and
recognised their old friend the dwarf.  Where are you going to? Rose Red asked.
Youre surely not going to jump into the water?  Im not such a fool, screamed
the dwarf. Dont you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?  The little
man had been sitting on the bank, fishing, when unfortunately the wind had
entangled his beard in the line. Immediately afterward a big fish bit, and the
feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out. The fish dragged the
dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every reed and blade of
grass.  The girls came up just in the nick of time, held him firm, and did all
they could to free his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in
a hopeless muddle. All they could do was to take out the scissors again to cut
the beard.  The little man was far from grateful to the girls for rescuing him.
He yelled to them, Do you call that manners, you toadstools, to disfigure a
fellows face?  It wasnt enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must
now cut off the best bit of it.  Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay
among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and
disappeared behind a stone.  It happened that soon after this the mother sent
the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their
road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.
While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly
above them, but always swooping lower, until at last it settled on a rock not
far from them.  Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They
ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old
friend, the dwarf, and was about to carry him off. The tender-hearted children
seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last
he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he
screamed in his screeching voice, Couldnt you have treated me more carefully?
You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds!  Then he took a bag of
precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were used
to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On
their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf
pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one
would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering
stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood
still and gazed on them.  What are you standing gaping there for? Screamed the
dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became scarlet with rage. He was about to go off
with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted
out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadnt time to
escape down his hole, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in
terror, Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! Ill give you all my treasure. Look at those
beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! What pleasure would you
get from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You wont feel me between your
teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel
for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heavens sake. But the bear,
paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with
his paw, and he never moved again. The girls had run away, but the bear called
after them, Snow White and Rose Red, dont be afraid. Wait, and Ill come with
you. Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was
quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood
beside them, all dressed in gold.  I am a kings son, he said, and have been
doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about
the woods as a wild bear until his death should set me free. Now he has got his
well-merited punishment.  In due course, when the girls were old enough, Snow
White married the prince who had been a bear, and Rose Red - his brother, and
they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between
them. The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she
carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and
every year they bore the finest red and white roses.

Quote = ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and
most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had been married before, and already
had two daughters who were exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by
his first wife, a young daughter, but of unequalled goodness and sweetness of
temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.
This sweet little girl missed her mother, who had died, terribly much No sooner
was the wedding ceremony over, than the new wife began to show herself in her
true colours. She could not bear the goodness of the gentlemans pretty girl,
and especially as she made her own daughters appear the more horrid. She made
her do the meanest jobs in the house. The girl scoured the dishes and tables,
and scrubbed the stepmothers bathroom, and those of her daughters. She slept in
a little attic, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay upon beds with
the softest pillows, in fine rooms, with floors covered with beautiful carpets,
and walls on which hung looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves
at their full length from head to foot.  The poor girl bore all patiently, and
dared not tell her father, who would have been angry with her; for his new wife
ruled him entirely. When the little girl had done her work, she used to go into
the chimney corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which led her to be
called Cinderwench; but the youngest stepdaughter, who was not quite so rude
and unkind as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, dressed
in rags was a hundred times prettier than her sisters, though they were always
dressed very richly.  It happened that the kings son gave a ball, and invited
all the finest gentlemen and ladies of the city. Our young misses were also
invited, for they were always to be seen at fashionable parties. They were
truly delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing such
gowns, petticoats, and headdresses as might suit them. This was a new trouble
to Cinderella, for it was she who washed and ironed her sisters clothes and got
all their things ready. Meanwhile, the sisters talked all day long of nothing
but what they should wear to the ball.  For my part, said the eldest, I will
wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.  And I, said the youngest, shall
have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my
gold-flowered gown, and my diamond belt, which is far from being the most
ordinary one in the world.  But in truth, they were still not absolutely sure
what would be best to wear to the ball, so they sent for the best fashion
designer they could find to advise on their evening dresses, and they had their
nails manicured at Mademoiselle de la Poche.  Cinderella was likewise called up
to them for advice, for she had excellent judgement, and advised them always
for the best, indeed, and offered her services to make up their hair, which
they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:
Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?  Alas! Said she. You only
jeer me. It is not for a poor girl like me to go there.  Youre quite right,
replied they, it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.
Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads all wrong, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly well.  The stepsisters were almost two
days without eating, so much were they thrilled and excited. They broke above a
dozen corsets in trying to be laced up tightly, so that they might have a fine
slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last the
happy day came. They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes
as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.
Just then, her fairy godmother, who used to watch over her secretly, saw her
all in tears, and appeared at her side and asked her what was the matter.  I
wish I could  I wish I could She was not able to speak the rest, being
interrupted by her tears and sobbing.  This fairy godmother of hers said to
her: You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?  Y-es, cried Cinderella,
with a great sigh.  Well, said her godmother, be but a good girl, and I will
see that you shall go to the ball. Then she took her into her secret room, and
said to her: Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.  Cinderella went
immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her
godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the
ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of the big vegetable, leaving
nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin
was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.  She then
went to look into her mousetrap, where she found six mice, all alive, and
ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor. As each mouse went out,
she gave it a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned
into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a
beautiful mouse-coloured dapple-grey. But they still needed a coachman.  I will
go and see, said Cinderella, if there is a rat in the rattrap  we may make a
coachman of him.  Youre a smart one, replied her godmother, go and look.
Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The
fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and having
touched him with her wand, was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the
smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.  After that, she said to her: Go again into
the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering can, bring them
to me.  She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six
footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their uniforms all
bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they
had done nothing else their whole lives. The fairy then said to Cinderella:
Well, you have here transport fit to take you to the ball. Are you not pleased
with it?  Oh yes, cried she, but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?
Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and at the same instant, her
clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This
done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.
Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all
things, commanded her not to stay until after midnight, telling her at the same
time that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again,
her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes
become just as they were before.  She promised her godmother she would not fail
to leave the ball before midnight; and then away she went, scarce able to
contain herself for joy. The kings son who was told that a great princess, whom
nobody knew, was to come, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she
alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.
There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the
violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular
beauty of the unknown newcomer.  Nothing was then heard but a confused noise
of: Ah! How lovely she is! Ah! How lovely she is!  The king himself, old as he
was, could not help watching her, and telling the queen softly that it was a
long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.  All the ladies
were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some
made the next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such
fine material and as able hands to make them.  The kings son led her to the
most honourable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him. She danced
so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine banquet was
served up, of which the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he
busied in gazing on her.  She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a
thousand polite gestures, giving them part of the oranges and lemon blossoms
which the prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for
they did not recognise her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she
heard the clock strike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately
made a curtsy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.  When she
got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and after having thanked her, she
said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because
the kings son had desired her.  As she was eagerly telling her godmother
whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which
Cinderella ran and opened.  How long you have stayed! Cried she, gaping,
rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just woken out of
her sleep. She had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they
went from home.  If you had been at the ball, said one of her sisters, you
would not have been tired. There came there the finest princess, the most
beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes. She was a thousand times nice to us,
and gave us orange and lemon blossoms.  Cinderella seemed very indifferent in
the matter, indeed, she asked them the name of that princess, but they told her
they did not know it, and that the kings son was very uneasy on her account and
would give all the world to know who she was.  At this Cinderella, smiling,
replied: She must then be very beautiful indeed. How happy you have been! Could
not I see her? Ah! Dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes
which you wear everyday.  Aye, to be sure! Cried Miss Charlotte. Lend my
clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you! I should be a fool.  Cinderella
indeed expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she
would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for
jokingly.  The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was
Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The kings son was
always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to
whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock
striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven. She then rose up
and fled, as nimble as a deer. The prince followed, but could not overtake her.
She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the prince took up most
carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes,
having nothing left of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to
that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen
a princess go out. They replied that they had seen nobody go out but a young
girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench
than a gentlewoman.  When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella
asked them if they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.
They told her yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve,
and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the
prettiest in the world, which the kings son had taken up; that he had done
nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he
was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.
What they said was very true, for a few days after the kings son commanded it
to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry the young woman
whose foot would perfectly fit the slipper. He sent out his most trusted
advisers from the palace, who began to try it upon the princesses, then the
duchesses and all the court, but in vain. It was then brought to the two
sisters, who each did all that she possibly could to thrust her foot into the
slipper, but neither sister could manage to do so. Cinderella, who saw all
this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing: Let me see if it will not
fit me.  Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to tease her. The
gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and
finding her very handsome, said it was only right that she should try, and that
he had orders to let every girl try.  He asked Cinderella to sit down, and
putting the slipper to her foot, found it went on very easily, and fitted her
as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was
excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of
her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her
godmother, who having touched with her wand Cinderellas clothes, made them
richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.  Now her two
sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the
ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill treatment
they had dished out to her. Cinderella took them up, and as she embraced them,
cried that she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love
her.  She was brought by carriage to the young prince, dressed as she was. He
thought her more charming than ever, and a few days after, married her.
Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters rooms in
the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the
court.

Quote = When I was a lad, my father used to send me out to the fields each day to watch
over his sheep. Hey now! There are worse jobs than sitting out in the fresh air
all day, but it was boring work for a lad. I longed to be running around with
my friends, playing ball, or making boyish mischief.  Cant the sheep look after
themselves? I asked my father. After all, they know how to bleat and munch
grass, but there isnt much else that they do.  Father said it was important
work, and most importantly of all, I must keep my eyes peeled for the wolf  in
case he came sneaking into the fields and grabbed one of the spring lambs.  I
couldnt even go to sleep. I had to sit and keep a sharp look out. After a few
weeks of this, I got so bored that I began to wish that the wolf would show up
and give me something to do.  Then I got thinking to myself: Lets liven things
up a bit, I thought. Lets play a trick on the villagers. So I got up and ran as
fast as I could into the village shouting at the top of my voice: Wolf! Wolf!
WOOOOOOOOLF!  The villagers grabbed sticks, rolling pins, and pitchforks and
came running up to the field to chase away the wolf.  But when they got there,
all was peaceful. The lambs were frolicking as usual, quite unmolested.  I
laughed: Ha ha! Fooled you all!  None of the villagers laughed with me. Some of
them grumbled and the blacksmith became quite angry and shouted at me  but he
was just a bad sport who couldnt see the funny side of my joke.  A week later I
did the same thing again, only this time I put on an even better act. I daubed
red paint on my arm, and pretended that the wolf had bitten me.  This fooled
even the blacksmith, who was on his guard after the last trick I had played.
When they all arrived breathless in the field, I again called out: Ha ha!
Fooled you!  This time, quite a few of the villagers were angry with me, and I
got quite an ear-wigging from the blacksmith, the teacher, and the iron-monger.
When I got home, my father was furious and told me that I had a stupid sense of
humour.  But I thought it was funny  and so did my friends.  About a week after
that, I was sitting up on the hill watching my fathers sheep as usual. It was
getting on for evening, and the sun was setting behind the forest. I would have
to spend the night out there, and oh, how lonely and bored was I. Then all of a
sudden the sheep dogs started to bark and the flock was running around and
bleating like they had all gone mad. Only they hadnt; there was a wolf among
the sheep and he had seized a lamb.  Wolf! Wolf! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF! I called
out and I ran into the village to get help.  But nobody came. Not one villager.
They carried on doing whatever they were doing. Eating supper, drinking ale, or
finishing off their work for the day.  Please, I said to the blacksmith. This
time its true. There really is a wolf.  But he just shrugged his shoulders.
You see nobody believes a liar, even when hes speaking the truth And thats why
you should never cry wolf unless you really mean it.

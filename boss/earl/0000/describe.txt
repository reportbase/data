        RepbaView is an excellent tool to view 360&deg; images. This is
        accomplished by using panorama, slideshow or manual viewing options.
        The slow constant rotation of panorama motion is an effective way to
        view 360&deg; images. The visual footer shows how the zoomed large
        image positionally relates to the full image. The visual footer can be
        enabled by clicking the center of the screen.  Standard RepaView
        zooming and vertical rotation user interaction commands are supported.

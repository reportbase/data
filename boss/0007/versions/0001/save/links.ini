Author = Oscar Wilde
quote = HIGH above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy
Prince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had
two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.  He was
very much admired indeed. He is as beautiful as a weathercock, remarked one of
the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic
tastes; only not quite so useful, he added, fearing lest people should think
him unpractical, which he really was not.  Why cant you be like the Happy
Prince? asked a sensible mother of her little boy who was crying for the moon.
The Happy Prince never dreams of crying for anything.  I am glad there is some
one in the world who is quite happy, muttered a disappointed man as he gazed at
the wonderful statue.  He looks just like an angel, said the Charity Children
as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their
clean white pinafores.  How do you know? said the Mathematical Master, you have
never seen one.  Ah! but we have, in our dreams, answered the children; and the
Mathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not approve of
children dreaming.  One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His
friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for
he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring
as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so
attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.  Shall I
love you? said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the
Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water
with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it
lasted all through the summer.  It is a ridiculous attachment, twittered the
other Swallows, she has no money, and far too many relations; and indeed the
river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.
After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. She has
no conversation, he said, and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is
always flirting with the wind. And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed
made the most graceful curtsies. I admit that she is domestic, he continued,
but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.
Will you come away with me? he said finally to her; but the Reed shook her
head, she was so attached to her home.  You have been trifling with me, he
cried, I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye! and he flew away.  All day long he
flew, and at night time he arrived at the city. Where shall I put up? he said;
I hope the town has made preparations.  Then he saw the statue on the tall
column. I will put up there, he cried; it is a fine position with plenty of
fresh air. So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.  I have a
golden bedroom, he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared
to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop
of water fell on him. What a curious thing! he cried, there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.
The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like
the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.  Then another drop fell.  What
is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off? he said; I must look for
a good chimney-pot, and he determined to fly away.  But before he had opened
his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked up, and saw - Ah! what did he see?
The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running
down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the
little Swallow was filled with pity.  Who are you? he said.  I am the Happy
Prince.  Why are you weeping then? asked the Swallow; you have quite drenched
me.  When I was alive and had a human heart, answered the statue, I did not
know what tears were, for I lived in the palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is
not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a
very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about
me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed
I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am
dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all
the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose
but weep.  What, is he not solid gold? said the Swallow to himself. He was too
polite to make any personal remarks out loud.  Far away, continued the statue
in a low musical voice, far away in a little street there is a poor house. One
of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her
face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the
needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion flowers on a satin
gown for the loveliest of the Queens maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court
ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a
fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring
her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I
cannot move.  I am waited for in Egypt, said the Swallow. My friends are flying
up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they will go
to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his
painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round
his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, will you not stay with me
for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and the mother so
sad.  I dont think I like boys, answered the Swallow. Last summer, when I was
staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the millers sons, who were
always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far
too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but
still, it was a mark of disrespect.  But the Happy Prince looked so sad that
the little Swallow was sorry. It is very cold here, he said; but I will stay
with you for one night, and be your messenger.  Thank you, little Swallow, said
the Prince.  So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Princes sword,
and flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.  He passed by the
cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured. He passed by
the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A beautiful girl came out on the
balcony with her lover. How wonderful the stars are, he said to her, and how
wonderful is the power of love!  I hope my dress will be ready in time for the
State ball, she answered; I have ordered passion flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.  At last he came to the poor house and
looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen
asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table
beside the womans thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boys
forehead with his wings. How cool I feel, said the boy, I must be getting
better; and he sank into a delicious slumber.  Then the Swallow flew back to
the Happy Prince, and told him what he had done. It is curious, he remarked,
but I feel quite warm now, although it is so cold.  That is because you have
done a good action, said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to think, and
then he fell asleep. Thinking always made him sleepy.  When day broke he flew
down to the river and had a bath. What a remarkable phenomenon, said the
Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge. A swallow in
winter! And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper. Every one
quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.
Tonight I go to Egypt, said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the
prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of
the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each
other, What a distinguished stranger! so he enjoyed himself very much.  When
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. Have you any commissions for
Egypt? he cried; I am just starting.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said
the Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  I am waited for in
Egypt, answered the Swallow. Tomorrow my friends will fly up to the Second
Cataract. The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great
granite throne sits the god Memnon. All night long he watches the stars, and
when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.
At noon the yellow lions come down to the waters edge to drink. They have eyes
like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.
Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the prince, far away across the city I
see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and
in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets. His hair is
brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and
dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but
he is too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has
made him faint.  I will wait with you one night longer, said the Swallow, who
really had a good heart. Shall I take him another ruby?  Alas! I have no ruby
now, said the Prince; my eyes are all that I have left. They are made of rare
sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck out one
of them and take it to him. He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and
firewood, and finish his play.  Dear Prince, said the Swallow, I cannot do
that; and he began to weep.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince,
do as I command you.  So the Swallow plucked out the Princes eye, and flew away
to the students garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in
the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his
head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the birds wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered
violets.  I am beginning to be appreciated, he cried; this is from some great
admirer. Now I can finish my play, and he looked quite happy.  The next day the
Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. Heave a-hoy!
they shouted as each chest came up. I am going to Egypt! cried the Swallow, but
nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.  I am
come to bid you good-bye, he cried.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the
Prince, will you not stay with me one night longer?  It is winter, answered the
Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the
green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.
My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and
white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must
leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be
redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.  In
the square below, said the Happy Prince, there stands a little match-girl. She
has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled. Her father
will beat her if she does not bring home some money, and she is crying. She has
no shoes or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck out my other eye, and
give it to her, and her father will not beat her.  I will stay with you one
night longer, said the Swallow, but I cannot pluck out your eye. You would be
quite blind then.  Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, said the Prince, do as I
command you.  So he plucked out the Princes other eye, and darted down with it.
He swooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. What a lovely bit of glass, cried the little girl; and she ran home,
laughing.  Then the Swallow came back to the Prince. You are blind now, he
said, so I will stay with you always.  No, little Swallow, said the poor
Prince, you must go away to Egypt.  I will stay with you always, said the
Swallow, and he slept at the Princes feet.  All the next day he sat on the
Princes shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He
told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile,
and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world
itself and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who
walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands;
of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and
worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree,
and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail
over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the
butterflies.  Dear little Swallow, said the Prince, you tell me of marvellous
things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.
There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and
tell me what you see there.  So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting
at the gates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving
children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a
bridge two little boys were lying in one anothers arms to try and keep
themselves warm. How hungry we are! they said. You must not lie here, shouted
the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.  Then he flew back and told
the Prince what he had seen.  I am covered with fine gold, said the Prince, you
must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think
that gold can make them happy.  Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf
of the fine gold he brought to the poor, and the childrens faces grew rosier,
and they laughed and played games in the street. We have bread now! they cried.
Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets looked as if
they were made of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long icicles like
crystal daggers hung down from the eaves of the houses, everybody went about in
furs, and the little boys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.  The poor
little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not leave the Prince, he
loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the bakers door where the baker
was not looking, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping his wings.  But at
last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to fly up to the
Princes shoulder once more. Good-bye, dear Prince! he murmured, will you let me
kiss your hand?  I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,
said the Prince, you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the
lips, for I love you.  It is not to Egypt that I am going, said the Swallow. I
am going to the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?  And
he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his feet.  At
that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had
broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had snapped right in two. It
certainly was a dreadfully hard frost. Early the next morning the Mayor was
walking in the square below in company with the Town Councillors. As they
passed the column he looked up at the statue: Dear me! how shabby the Happy
Prince looks! he said.  How shabby indeed! cried the Town Councillors, who
always agreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.  The ruby has
fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is golden no longer, said
the Mayor; in fact, he is little better than a beggar!  Little better than a
beggar said the Town councillors.  And here is actually a dead bird at his
feet! continued the Mayor. We must really issue a proclamation that birds are
not to be allowed to die here. And the Town Clerk made a note of the
suggestion.  So they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. As he is no
longer beautiful he is no longer useful, said the Art Professor at the
University.  Then they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a
meeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal. We
must have another statue, of course, he said, and it shall be a statue of
myself.  Of myself, said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.
When I last heard of them they were quarrelling still.  What a strange thing!
said the overseer of the workmen at the foundry. This broken lead heart will
not melt in the furnace. We must throw it away. So they threw it on a dust heap
where the dead Swallow was also lying.  Bring me the two most precious things
in the city, said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the
leaden heart and the dead bird.  You have rightly chosen, said God, for in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of
gold the Happy Prince shall praise me.

Title = Tell Tale Heart
Author = Edger Allan Poe
Quote =  True! --nervous --very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but
why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses --not
destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard
all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How,
then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how calmly I can tell you
the whole story.  It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain;
but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion
there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never
given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it
was this!  He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually
--I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the
eye forever.  Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But
you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded --with
what caution --with what foresight --with what dissimulation I went to work! I
was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.
And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it
--oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I
put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, that no light shone out, and then I
thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it
in! I moved it slowly --very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old
man's sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so
far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would a madman have been
so wise as this, And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the
lantern cautiously-oh, so cautiously --cautiously (for the hinges creaked) --I
undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. And
this I did for seven long nights --every night just at midnight --but I found
the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not
the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye. And every morning, when the day
broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling
him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you
see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every
night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.  Upon the eighth
night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the
extent of my own powers --of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings
of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and
he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the
idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if
startled. Now you may think that I drew back --but no. His room was as black as
pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through
fear of robbers,) and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door,
and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. I had my head in, and was about to
open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man
sprang up in bed, crying out --"Who's there?" I kept quite still and said
nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did
not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; --just as
I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.
Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.
It was not a groan of pain or of grief --oh, no! --it was the low stifled sound
that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the
sound well. Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has
welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors
that distracted me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old man felt, and
pitied him, although I chuckled at heart. I knew that he had been lying awake
ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. His fears had
been ever since growing upon him. He had been trying to fancy them causeless,
but could not. He had been saying to himself --"It is nothing but the wind in
the chimney --it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or "It is merely a
cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes, he had been trying to comfort
himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. All in vain;
because Death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him,
and enveloped the victim. And it was the mournful influence of the unperceived
shadow that caused him to feel --although he neither saw nor heard --to feel
the presence of my head within the room.  When I had waited a long time, very
patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little --a very,
very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it --you cannot imagine how
stealthily, stealthily --until, at length a simple dim ray, like the thread of
the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye. It
was open --wide, wide open --and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it
with perfect distinctness --all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that
chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old
man's face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely
upon the damned spot. And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness
is but over-acuteness of the sense?  --now, I say, there came to my ears a low,
dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I knew that
sound well, too. It was the beating of the old man's heart. It increased my
fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.  But even
yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely breathed. I held the lantern
motionless. I tried how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eve.
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. It grew quicker and
quicker, and louder and louder every instant. The old man's terror must have
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every moment! --do you mark me well
I have told you that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead hour of the
night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this
excited me to uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer I refrained
and stood still. But the beating grew louder, louder! I thought the heart must
burst. And now a new anxiety seized me --the sound would be heard by a
neighbour! The old man's hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the
lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once --once only. In an instant I
dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on
with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard
through the wall. At length it ceased. The old man was dead. I removed the bed
and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon
the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone
dead. His eye would trouble me no more.  If still you think me mad, you will
think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the
concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence.
First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the
legs. I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and
deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly,
so cunningly, that no human eye --not even his --could have detected any thing
wrong. There was nothing to wash out --no stain of any kind --no blood-spot
whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all --ha! ha! When I
had made an end of these labors, it was four o'clock --still dark as midnight.
As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went
down to open it with a light heart, --for what had I now to fear? There entered
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the
police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion of
foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office,
and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. I smiled,
--for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was
my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took
my visitors all over the house.  I bade them search --search well. I led them,
at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In
the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired
them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of
my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed
the corpse of the victim.  The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they
chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and
wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still
they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: --It continued
and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but
it continued and gained definiteness --until, at length, I found that the noise
was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more
fluently, and with a heightened voice.  Yet the sound increased --and what
could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound --much such a sound as a watch
makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers
heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily
increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent
gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. Why would they not be gone? I
paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the
observations of the men --but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could
I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been
sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and
continually increased. It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men
chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God!
--no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! --they were making a
mockery of my horror!-this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better
than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear
those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! and now
--again! --hark! louder! louder! louder!  louder!  "Villains!" I shrieked,
"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! --tear up the planks! here, here! --It is
the beating of his hideous heart!"

Author = O. Henry
Quote = One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it
was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer
and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent
imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della
counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
Christmas.  There was clearly nothing left to do but flop down on the shabby
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection
that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles
predominating.  While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the
first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per
week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on
the look-out for the mendicancy squad.  In the vestibule below was a letter-box
into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal
finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the
name "Mr. James Dillingham Young." The "Dillingham" had been flung to the
breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid
$30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of
"Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of
contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham
Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly
hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della.
Which is all very good.  Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with
the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat
walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. To-morrow would be Christmas Day, and
she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every
penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only
$1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent
planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and
sterling--something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of
being owned by Jim.  There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room.
Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 Bat. A very thin and very agile
person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal
strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender,
had mastered the art.  Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before
the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour
within twenty seconds.  Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its
full length.  Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in
which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his
father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of
Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang
out of the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and
gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in
the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to
see him pluck at his beard from envy.  So now Della's beautiful hair fell about
her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again
nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a
tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.  On went her old brown jacket; on
went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle
still in her eyes, she cluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the
street.  Where she stopped the sign read: "Mme Sofronie. Hair Goods of All
Kinds." One Eight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large,
too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie." "Will you buy my hair?" asked
Della.  "I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at
the looks of it." Down rippled the brown cascade.  "Twenty dollars," said
Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.  "Give it to me quick" said
Della.  Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed
metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.  She found it at
last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like
it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a
platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value
by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation--as all good things
should do. It was even worthy of The Watch.  As soon as she saw it she knew
that it must be Jim's. It was like him.  Quietness and value--the description
applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried
home with the 78 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly
anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes
looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in
place of a chain.  When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and
went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is
always a tremendous task dear friends--a mammoth task.  Within forty minutes
her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look
wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror
long, carefully, and critically.  "If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to
herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney
Island chorus girl. But what could I do--oh! what could I do with a dollar and
eighty-seven cents?" At 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.  Jim was never late.
Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near
the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down
on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of
saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she
whispered: "Please, God, make him think I am still pretty." The door opened and
Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he
was only twenty-two--and to be burdened with a family!  He needed a new
overcoat and he was with out gloves.  Jim stepped inside the door, as immovable
as a setter at the scent of quail.  His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there
was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was
not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments
that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that
peculiar expression on his face.  Della wriggled off the table and went for
him.  "Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut
off and sold it because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving
you a present. It'll grow out again--you won't mind, will you? I just had to do
it.  My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be
happy. You don't know what a nice-what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for
you." "You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not
arrived at that patent fact yet, even after the hardest mental labour.  "Cut it
off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow?  I'm me
without my hair, ain't I?" Jim looked about the room curiously.  "You say your
hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.  "You needn't look for
it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you--sold and gone, too. It's Christmas
Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were
numbered," she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever
count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?" Out of his trance Jim
seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard
with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction.
Eight dollars a week or a million a year--what is the difference? A
mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought
valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be
illuminated later on.  Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it
upon the table.  "Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't
think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that
could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may
see why you had me going a while at first." White fingers and nimble tore at
the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a
quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the
immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.  For
there lay The Combs--the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped
for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise-shell, with
jewelled rims--just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were
expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over
them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the
tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.  But she
hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes
and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!" And then Della leaped up
like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!" Jim had not yet seen his
beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull
precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent
spirit.  "Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have
to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to
see how it looks on it." Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and
put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.  "Dell," said he, "let's
put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while.  They're too nice to use
just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now
suppose you put the chops on." The magi, as you know, were wise
men--wonderfully wise men-who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They
invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no
doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of
duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of
two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the
greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who
give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest.
They are the magi.

Title = The Little Match Girl
Author = Hans Christian Andersen 
Quote = Most terribly cold it was; it snowed,
and was nearly quite dark, and evening-- the last evening of the year. In this
cold and darkness there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded,
and with naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but
what was the good of that? They were very large slippers, which her mother had
hitherto worn; so large were they; and the poor little thing lost them as she
scuffled away across the street, because of two carriages that rolled by
dreadfully fast.  One slipper was nowhere to be found; the other had been laid
hold of by an urchin, and off he ran with it; he thought it would do capitally
for a cradle when he some day or other should have children himself. So the
little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue
from cold. She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a
bundle of them in her hand. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole
livelong day; no one had given her a single farthing.  She crept along
trembling with cold and hunger--a very picture of sorrow, the poor little
thing!  The flakes of snow covered her long fair hair, which fell in beautiful
curls around her neck; but of that, of course, she never once now thought. From
all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast
goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve; yes, of that she thought.  In a
corner formed by two houses, of which one advanced more than the other, she
seated herself down and cowered together. Her little feet she had drawn close
up to her, but she grew colder and colder, and to go home she did not venture,
for she had not sold any matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from
her father she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for
above her she had only the roof, through which the wind whistled, even though
the largest cracks were stopped up with straw and rags.  Her little hands were
almost numbed with cold. Oh! a match might afford her a world of comfort, if
she only dared take a single one out of the bundle, draw it against the wall,
and warm her fingers by it. She drew one out. "Rischt!" how it blazed, how it
burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over
it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though
she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a
brass ornament at top. The fire burned with such blessed influence; it warmed
so delightfully. The little girl had already stretched out her feet to warm
them too; but--the small flame went out, the stove vanished: she had only the
remains of the burnt-out match in her hand.  She rubbed another against the
wall: it burned brightly, and where the light fell on the wall, there the wall
became transparent like a veil, so that she could see into the room. On the
table was spread a snow-white tablecloth; upon it was a splendid porcelain
service, and the roast goose was steaming famously with its stuffing of apple
and dried plums. And what was still more capital to behold was, the goose
hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its
breast, till it came up to the poor little girl; when--the match went out and
nothing but the thick, cold, damp wall was left behind. She lighted another
match. Now there she was sitting under the most magnificent Christmas tree: it
was still larger, and more decorated than the one which she had seen through
the glass door in the rich merchant's house.  Thousands of lights were burning
on the green branches, and gaily-colored pictures, such as she had seen in the
shop-windows, looked down upon her. The little maiden stretched out her hands
towards them when--the match went out.  The lights of the Christmas tree rose
higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and
formed a long trail of fire.  "Someone is just dead!" said the little girl; for
her old grandmother, the only person who had loved her, and who was now no
more, had told her, that when a star falls, a soul ascends to God.  She drew
another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there
stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant, so mild, and with such an
expression of love.  "Grandmother!" cried the little one. "Oh, take me with
you! You go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove, like
the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas tree!" And she
rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against the wall, for she wanted to
be quite sure of keeping her grandmother near her. And the matches gave such a
brilliant light that it was brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the
grandmother been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her
arm, and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and then
above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety--they were with God.  But in
the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with rosy cheeks and
with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last
evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches,
of which one bundle had been burnt. "She wanted to warm herself," people said.
No one had the slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no
one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered
on the joys of a new year.

Title = A Dark Brown Dog
Author = Stephen Crane
Quote = A Child was standing on a street-corner. He leaned with one shoulder against a
high board-fence and swayed the other to and fro, the while kicking carelessly
at the gravel.  Sunshine beat upon the cobbles, and a lazy summer wind raised
yellow dust which trailed in clouds down the avenue. Clattering trucks moved
with indistinctness through it. The child stood dreamily gazing.  After a time,
a little dark-brown dog came trotting with an intent air down the sidewalk. A
short rope was dragging from his neck. Occasionally he trod upon the end of it
and stumbled.  He stopped opposite the child, and the two regarded each other.
The dog hesitated for a moment, but presently he made some little advances with
his tail. The child put out his hand and called him. In an apologetic manner
the dog came close, and the two had an interchange of friendly pattings and
waggles. The dog became more enthusiastic with each moment of the interview,
until with his gleeful caperings he threatened to overturn the child. Whereupon
the child lifted his hand and struck the dog a blow upon the head.  This thing
seemed to overpower and astonish the little dark-brown dog, and wounded him to
the heart. He sank down in despair at the child's feet. When the blow was
repeated, together with an admonition in childish sentences, he turned over
upon his back, and held his paws in a peculiar manner. At the same time with
his ears and his eyes he offered a small prayer to the child.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  He looked so comical on his
back, and holding his paws peculiarly, that the child was greatly amused and
gave him little taps repeatedly, to keep him so. But the little dark-brown dog
took this chastisement in the most serious way, and no doubt considered that he
had committed some grave crime, for he wriggled contritely and showed his
repentance in every way that was in his power. He pleaded with the child and
petitioned him, and offered more prayers.  At last the child grew weary of this
amusement and turned toward home. The dog was praying at the time. He lay on
his back and turned his eyes upon the retreating form.  Presently he struggled
to his feet and started after the child. The latter wandered in a perfunctory
way toward his home, stopping at times to investigate various matters. During
one of these pauses he discovered the little dark-brown dog who was following
him with the air of a footpad.  The child beat his pursuer with a small stick
he had found. The dog lay down and prayed until the child had finished, and
resumed his journey. Then he scrambled erect and took up the pursuit again.  On
the way to his home the child turned many times and beat the dog, proclaiming
with childish gestures that he held him in contempt as an unimportant dog, with
no value save for a moment. For being this quality of animal the dog apologized
and eloquently expressed regret, but he continued stealthily to follow the
child. His manner grew so very guilty that he slunk like an assassin.  When the
child reached his door-step, the dog was industriously ambling a few yards in
the rear. He became so agitated with shame when he again confronted the child
that he forgot the dragging rope. He tripped upon it and fell forward.  The
child attempts to drag the dark brown dog The child sat down on the step and
the two had another interview. During it the dog greatly exerted himself to
please the child. He performed a few gambols with such abandon that the child
suddenly saw him to be a valuable thing. He made a swift, avaricious charge and
seized the rope.  He dragged his captive into a hall and up many long stairways
in a dark tenement. The dog made willing efforts, but he could not hobble very
skillfully up the stairs because he was very small and soft, and at last the
pace of the engrossed child grew so energetic that the dog became
panic-stricken. In his mind he was being dragged toward a grim unknown. His
eyes grew wild with the terror of it. He began to wiggle his head frantically
and to brace his legs.  The child redoubled his exertions. They had a battle on
the stairs. The child was victorious because he was completely absorbed in his
purpose, and because the dog was very small. He dragged his acquirement to the
door of his home, and finally with triumph across the threshold.  Presently he
struggled to his feet and started after the child.  No one was in.  The child
sat down on the floor and made overtures to the dog. These the dog instantly
accepted. He beamed with affection upon his new friend. In a short time they
were firm and abiding comrades.  When the child's family appeared, they made a
great row. The dog was examined and commented upon and called names. Scorn was
leveled at him from all eyes, so that he became much embarrassed and drooped
like a scorched plant. But the child went sturdily to the center of the floor,
and, at the top of his voice, championed the dog. It happened that he was
roaring protestations, with his arms clasped about the dog's neck, when the
father of the family came in from work.  The parent demanded to know what the
blazes they were making the kid howl for.  It was explained in many words that
the infernal kid wanted to introduce a disreputable dog into the family.  A
family council was held. On this depended the dog's fate, but he in no way
heeded, being busily engaged in chewing the end of the child's dress.  The
affair was quickly ended. The father of the family, it appears, was in a
particularly savage temper that evening, and when he perceived that it would
amaze and anger everybody if such a dog were allowed to remain, he decided that
it should be so. The child, crying softly, took his friend off to a retired
part of the room to hobnob with him, while the father quelled a fierce
rebellion of his wife. So it came to pass that the dog was a member of the
household.  He and the child were associated together at all times save when
the child slept. The child became a guardian and a friend. If the large folk
kicked the dog and threw things at him, the child made loud and violent
objections. Once when the child had run, protesting loudly, with tears raining
down his face and his arms outstretched, to protect his friend, he had been
struck in the head with a very large saucepan from the hand of his father,
enraged at some seeming lack of courtesy in the dog. Ever after, the family
were careful how they threw things at the dog. Moreover, the latter grew very
skilful in avoiding missiles and feet. In a small room containing a stove, a
table, a bureau and some chairs, he would display strategic ability of a high
order, dodging, feinting and scuttling about among the furniture. He could
force three or four people armed with brooms, sticks and handfuls of coal, to
use all their ingenuity to get in a blow. And even when they did, it was seldom
that they could do him a serious injury or leave any imprint.  But when the
child was present, these scenes did not occur. It came to be recognized that if
the dog was molested, the child would burst into sobs, and as the child, when
started, was very riotous and practically unquenchable, the dog had therein a
safeguard.  However, the child could not always be near. At night, when he was
asleep, his dark-brown friend would raise from some black corner a wild,
wailful cry, a song of infinite lowliness and despair, that would go shuddering
and sobbing among the buildings of the block and cause people to swear. At
these times the singer would often be chased all over the kitchen and hit with
a great variety of articles.  Sometimes, too, the child himself used to beat
the dog, although it is not known that he ever had what could be truly called a
just cause. The dog always accepted these thrashings with an air of admitted
guilt. He was too much of a dog to try to look to be a martyr or to plot
revenge. He received the blows with deep humility, and furthermore he forgave
his friend the moment the child had finished, and was ready to caress the
child's hand with his little red tongue.  When misfortune came upon the child,
and his troubles overwhelmed him, he would often crawl under the table and lay
his small distressed head on the dog's back. The dog was ever sympathetic. It
is not to be supposed that at such times he took occasion to refer to the
unjust beatings his friend, when provoked, had administered to him.  He did not
achieve any notable degree of intimacy with the other members of the family. He
had no confidence in them, and the fear that he would express at their casual
approach often exasperated them exceedingly. They used to gain a certain
satisfaction in underfeeding him, but finally his friend the child grew to
watch the matter with some care, and when he forgot it, the dog was often
successful in secret for himself.  So the dog prospered. He developed a large
bark, which came wondrously from such a small rug of a dog. He ceased to howl
persistently at night. Sometimes, indeed, in his sleep, he would utter little
yells, as from pain, but that occurred, no doubt, when in his dreams he
encountered huge flaming dogs who threatened him direfully.  His devotion to
the child grew until it was a sublime thing. He wagged at his approach; he sank
down in despair at his departure. He could detect the sound of the child's step
among all the noises of the neighborhood. It was like a calling voice to him.
The scene of their companionship was a kingdom governed by this terrible
potentate, the child; but neither criticism nor rebellion ever lived for an
instant in the heart of the one subject. Down in the mystic, hidden fields of
his little dog-soul bloomed flowers of love and fidelity and perfect faith.
The child was in the habit of going on many expeditions to observe strange
things in the vicinity. On these occasions his friend usually jogged aimfully
along behind. Perhaps, though, he went ahead. This necessitated his turning
around every quarter-minute to make sure the child was coming. He was filled
with a large idea of the importance of these journeys. He would carry himself
with such an air! He was proud to be the retainer of so great a monarch.  One
day, however, the father of the family got quite exceptionally drunk. He came
home and held carnival with the cooking utensils, the furniture and his wife.
He was in the midst of this recreation when the child, followed by the
dark-brown dog, entered the room. They were returning from their voyages.  He
was the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The child's
practised eye instantly noted his father's state. He dived under the table,
where experience had taught him was a rather safe place. The dog, lacking skill
in such matters, was, of course, unaware of the true condition of affairs. He
looked with interested eyes at his friend's sudden dive. He interpreted it to
mean: Joyous gambol. He started to patter across the floor to join him. He was
the picture of a little dark-brown dog en route to a friend.  The head of the
family saw him at this moment. He gave a huge howl of joy, and knocked the dog
down with a heavy coffee-pot. The dog, yelling in supreme astonishment and
fear, writhed to his feet and ran for cover. The man kicked out with a
ponderous foot. It caused the dog to swerve as if caught in a tide.  A second
blow of the coffee-pot laid him upon the floor.  Here the child, uttering loud
cries, came valiantly forth like a knight. The father of the family paid no
attention to these calls of the child, but advanced with glee upon the dog.
Upon being knocked down twice in swift succession, the latter apparently gave
up all hope of escape. He rolled over on his back and held his paws in a
peculiar manner. At the same time with his eyes and his ears he offered up a
small prayer.  But the father was in a mood for having fun, and it occurred to
him that it would be a fine thing to throw the dog out of the window. So he
reached down and grabbing the animal by a leg, lifted him, squirming, up. He
swung him two or three times hilariously about his head, and then flung him
with great accuracy through the window.  The soaring dog created a surprise in
the block. A woman watering plants in an opposite window gave an involuntary
shout and dropped a flower-pot. A man in another window leaned perilously out
to watch the flight of the dog. A woman, who had been hanging out clothes in a
yard, began to caper wildly. Her mouth was filled with clothes-pins, but her
arms gave vent to a sort of exclamation.  In appearance she was like a gagged
prisoner. Children ran whooping.  The dark-brown body crashed in a heap on the
roof of a shed five stories below.  From thence it rolled to the pavement of an
alleyway.  The child in the room far above burst into a long, dirgelike cry,
and toddled hastily out of the room. It took him a long time to reach the
alley, because his size compelled him to go downstairs backward, one step at a
time, and holding with both hands to the step above....they found him seated by
the body of his dark-brown friend.  When they came for him later, they found
him seated by the body of his dark-brown friend.

Title = The Story of An Hour
Author = Kate Chopin
Quote = Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great
care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's
death.  It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled
hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was
there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when
intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name
leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of
its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful,
less tender friend in bearing the sad message.  She did not hear the story as
many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its
significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's
arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone.
She would have no one follow her.  There stood, facing the open window, a
comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical
exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.  She could
see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver
with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the
street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which
someone was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering
in the eaves.  There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through
the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her
window.  She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite
motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child
who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.  She was young,
with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain
strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away
off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of
reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.  There
was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it?
She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it,
creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents,
the color that filled the air.  Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She
was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and
she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white
slender hands would have been.  When she abandoned herself a little whispered
word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under the
breath: "free, free, free!" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had
followed it went from her eyes.  They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat
fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.  She
did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A
clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial.
She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded
in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and
gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years
to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms
out to them in welcome.  There would be no one to live for during those coming
years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers
in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to
impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel
intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief
moment of illumination.  And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had
not. What did it matter!  What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in
the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as
the strongest impulse of her being!  "Free! Body and soul free!" she kept
whispering.  Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the
keyhole, imploring for admission. "Louise, open the door! I beg; open the
door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake
open the door." "Go away. I am not making myself ill." No; she was drinking in
a very elixir of life through that open window.  Her fancy was running riot
along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of
days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be
long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be
long.  She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities.
There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly
like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they
descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.  Someone
was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered,
a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had
been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been
one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to
screen him from the view of his wife.  When the doctors came they said she had
died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.

Title = A Horseman in the Sky
Author = Ambrose Bierce
Quote = One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 1861 a soldier lay in a
clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia. He lay at full
length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left
forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the
somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of
the cartridge-box at the back of his belt he might have been thought to be
dead. He was asleep at his post of duty. But if detected he would be dead
shortly afterward, death being the just and legal penalty of his crime.  The
clump of laurel in which the criminal lay was in the angle of a road which
after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point turned sharply to the
west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards. There it turned
southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient
of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out northward, overlooking
the deep valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a
stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand
feet to the tops of the pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another
spur of the same cliff. Had he been awake he would have commanded a view, not
only of the short arm of the road and the jutting rock, but of the entire
profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him giddy to look.  A
Horseman in the Sky: Seneca Rocks North Fork Mountain, West VirginiaThe country
was wooded everywhere except at the bottom of the valley to the northward,
where there was a small natural meadow, through which flowed a stream scarcely
visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked hardly larger than an
ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more
vivid than that of the inclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant
cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of
the savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the
summit. The configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point
of observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered how
the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and whence came
and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow more than a
thousand feet below.  No country is so wild and difficult but men will make it
a theatre of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military
rat-trap, in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have
starved an army to submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had
marched all the previous day and night and were resting. At nightfall they
would take to the road again, climb to the place where their unfaithful
sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the ridge fall upon a
camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to surprise it, for the
road led to the rear of it. In case of failure, their position would be
perilous in the extreme; and fail they surely would should accident or
vigilance apprise the enemy of the movement.  The sleeping sentinel in the
clump of laurel was a young Virginian named Carter Druse. He was the son of
wealthy parents, an only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and
high living as wealth and taste were able to command in the mountain country of
western Virginia. His home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One
morning he had risen from the breakfast-table and said, quietly but gravely:
"Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it." The
father lifted his leonine head, looked at the son a moment in silence, and
replied: "Well, go, sir, and whatever may occur do what you conceive to be your
duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we
both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter. Your
mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition; at
the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is
precious. It would be better not to disturb her." So Carter Druse, bowing
reverently to his father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy that
masked a breaking heart, left the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By
conscience and courage, by deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended
himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to
some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present
perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger
than resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a
dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a movement,
without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon,
some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his
consciousness--whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening
word which no human lips ever have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled.
He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking
stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of
his rifle.  His first feeling was a keen artistic delight. On a colossal
pedestal, the cliff,--motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and
sharply outlined against the sky,--was an equestrian statue of impressive
dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and
soldierly, but with the repose of a Grecian god carved in the marble which
limits the suggestion of activity. The gray costume harmonized with its arial
background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was softened and subdued by
the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine strikingly
foreshortened lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the right
hand grasping it at the "grip"; the left hand, holding the bridle rein, was
invisible. In silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with
the sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the
confronting cliffs beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away, showed
only an outline of temple and beard; he was looking downward to the bottom of
the valley. Magnified by its lift against the sky and by the soldier's
testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the group appeared of
heroic, almost colossal, size.  For an instant Druse had a strange,
half-defined feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking
upon a noble work of art reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of
an heroic past of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was
dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the horse, without moving its
feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the man remained
immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the
situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by
cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and
glancing through the sights covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A
touch upon the trigger and all would have been well with Carter Druse. At that
instant the horseman turned his head and looked in the direction of his
concealed foeman--seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his
brave, compassionate heart.  Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war--an
enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and
comrades--an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its
numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw
the statuesque group before him as black figures, rising, falling, moving
unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his
weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he
lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from
intensity of emotion.  It was not for long; in another moment his face was
raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger
sought the trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason
sound. He could not hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him
dashing to his camp with his fatal news. The duty of the soldier was plain: the
man must be shot dead from ambush--without warning, without a moment's
spiritual preparation, with never so much as an unspoken prayer, he must be
sent to his account. But no--there is a hope; he may have discovered
nothing--perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If
permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he
came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing
whether he knows. It may well be that his fixity of attention--Druse turned his
head and looked through the deeps of air downward, as from the surface to the
bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous
line of figures of men and horses--some foolish commander was permitting the
soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open, in plain view from a
dozen summits!  Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again
upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sights
of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they
were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: "Whatever
may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty." He was calm now. His teeth
were firmly but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping
babe's--not a tremor affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until
suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered;
the spirit had said to the body: "Peace, be still." He fired.  An officer of
the Federal force, who in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge had
left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and with aimless feet had made his way
to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff, was
considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration further. At a
distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone's throw, rose
from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a
height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a
sharp, rugged line against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile
against a background of blue sky to a point half the way down, and of distant
hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base. Lifting
his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer saw an astonishing
sight--a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air!
Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in the
saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a
plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like a plume.
His hands were concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane. The animal's
body was as level as if every hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its
motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they
ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting
from a leap. But this was a flight!  Filled with amazement and terror by this
apparition of a horseman in the sky--half believing himself the chosen scribe
of some new Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his
emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant he heard
a crashing sound in the trees--a sound that died without an echo--and all was
still.  The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The familiar sensation of an
abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself together he ran
rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot;
thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In
the fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by
the apparent grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it
did not occur to him that the line of march of arial cavalry is directly
downward, and that he could find the objects of his search at the very foot of
the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to camp.  This officer was a wise man;
he knew better than to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had
seen. But when the commander asked him if in his scout he had learned anything
of advantage to the expedition he answered: "Yes, sir; there is no road leading
down into this valley from the southward." The commander, knowing better,
smiled.  After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and
resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept
cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked
at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition.  "Did you fire?" the
sergeant whispered.  "Yes." "At what?" "A horse. It was standing on yonder
rock--pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff."
The man's face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. Having
answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant did not
understand.  "See here, Druse," he said, after a moment's silence, "it's no use
making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?"
"Yes." "Well?" "My father." The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away.
"Good God!" he said.

Title = Snow White
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = A very long time ago, in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling
like feathers from heaven, a beautiful queen sat sewing at her window, which
had a frame of black ebony. As she worked, she looked sometimes at the falling
snow, and it happened that she pricked her finger with her needle, so that
three drops of blood fell upon the snow. How pretty the red blood looked upon
the dazzling white! The queen said to herself as she looked it, Ah me! If only
I had a dear little child who had skin as white as the snow, lips as rosy as
the blood, and hair as black as the ebony window frame.  Soon afterwards she
had a little daughter, with skin white as snow, lips rosy as blood, and hair as
black as ebony  and she was therefore called Little Snow White.  But alas! When
the little one was born, the good queen died.  A year passed by, and the king
took another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she
could not bear that anyone else should surpass her in beauty. She had a mirror
and when she stood in front of it and asked, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who
is the fairest of us all?  The mirror answered, Thou, O Queen, art the fairest
of all, and the queen was contented, because she knew the mirror could speak
nothing but the truth.  But as time passed on, Little Snow White grew more and
more beautiful. When she was seven years old, she was as lovely as the bright
day, and still more lovely than the queen herself, so that when the lady one
day asked her mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest of us
all?  It answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to
see.  The queen was shocked, and grew yellow and green with envy, and from that
moment envy and pride grew in her heart like rank weeds, so that she had no
peace day or night, until one day she called a huntsman and said, Take the
child away into the woods and kill her, for I can no longer bear the sight of
her. When you return, bring with you her heart, that I may know you have obeyed
my will.  The huntsman dared not disobey, and he led Snow White out into the
woods and placed an arrow in his bow to pierce her innocent heart, but the
little girl cried and begged him saying, Ah dear huntsman, leave me my life! I
will run away into the wild forest, and never come home again.  And as she was
so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, Run away then, you poor
child. While to himself he thought, The wild beasts will soon have devoured
you, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from his heart since he no
longer had to kill her.  Then as a young wild boar came rushing by, he killed
it, took out its heart, and carried it home to the queen. The cook was ordered
to prepare this, and the wicked queen ate it, and thought she had eaten the
heart of Snow White.  Poor little Snow White was now all alone in the wild
wood, and so frightened was she that she trembled at every leaf that rustled.
Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and the
wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm. She kept on running until she
came to a little house, where she went in to rest.  Inside the cottage,
everything she saw was tiny, but more dainty and clean than words can tell.
Upon a white-covered table stood seven little plates and upon each plate lay a
little spoon, besides which there were seven knives and forks and seven little
goblets. Against the wall, and side by side, stood seven little beds covered
with perfectly white sheets.  Snow White was so hungry and thirsty that she
took a little food from each of the seven plates, and drank a few drops of wine
from each goblet, for she did not wish to take everything away from one. Then,
because she was so tired, she crept into one of the beds, but it did not suit
her, and so she tried the others, but one was too long, another too short, and
so on - until she came to the seventh, which suited her exactly. She said her
prayers and soon fell fast asleep.  When night fell, the masters of the little
house came home. They were seven dwarfs, who worked with a pick axe and spade,
searching for copper and gold in the heart of the mountains.  They lit their
seven candles and then saw that someone had been to visit them.  The first
said, Who has been sitting on my chair?  The second said, Who has been eating
from my plate?  The third, Who has taken a piece of my bread?  The fourth, Who
has taken some of my vegetables?  The fifth, Who has been using my fork?  The
sixth, Who has been cutting with my knife?  The seventh, Who has been drinking
out of my goblet?  The first looked around and saw that his bed was rumpled, so
he said, Who has been getting into my bed?  Then the others looked round and
each one cried, Someone has been on my bed too!  But the seventh, when he
looked at his bed, saw little Snow White, who was lying asleep there. He called
the others, who came running up, and they cried out with astonishment, and
brought their seven little candles and let the light fall on little Snow White.
Oh, heavens! Oh, heavens! Cried they. What a lovely child! They were so glad
that they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh
dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through the
night.  When the sun rose, Snow White awoke, and oh! How frightened she was
when she saw the seven little dwarfs. But they were very friendly, and asked
what her name was. My name is Snow White, she answered.  And how did you come
to get into our house? Asked the dwarfs.  Then she told them how her cruel
stepmother had intended her to be killed, but the huntsman had spared her life
and she had run on until she reached the little house. The dwarfs said, If you
will take care of our house; cook for us, make the beds, wash, mend, and knit,
and keep everything neat and clean, then you may stay with us and you shall
lack for nothing.  Yes, answered Snow White. With all my heart, and so she
stayed.  She kept the house neat and clean for the dwarfs, who went off early
in the morning to search for copper and gold in the mountains, and who expected
their meal to be standing ready for them when they returned at night.  All day
long Snow White was alone, and the good little dwarfs warned her to be careful
to let no one into the house. For, said they, your step mother will soon
discover that you are living here.  The queen, believing, of course, that Snow
White was dead, and that she had eaten her heart, and therefore she was again
the most beautiful lady in the land, went to her mirror, and said, Mirror,
mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  Then the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see.
Over the hills and far away, she dwells with seven dwarfs today.  How angry she
was, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth, and that the huntsman must
have deceived her. She thought and thought how she might kill Snow White, for
she knew she would have neither rest nor peace until she really was the most
beautiful in the land. At length she decided what to do. She painted her face
and dressed herself like an old pedlar woman, so that no one could recognise
her, and in this disguise she climbed the seven mountains that lay between her
and the dwarfs house, and knocked at their door and cried, Pretty things to
sell, very cheap, very cheap.  Snow White peeped from the window and said, Good
day, good wife, and what are your wares?  All sorts of pretty things, my dear,
answered the woman. Silken laces of every colour, and she held up a brightly
coloured one, made of plaited silks.  Surely I might let this honest old woman
come in? Snow White thought, and unbolted the door and bought the pretty lace.
Dear, dear, what a sight for sore eyes you are, child, said the old woman.
Come, let me lace you properly for once.  Snow White had no suspicious
thoughts, so she placed herself in front of the old woman that she might fasten
her dress with the new silk lace. Immediately the wicked creature laced her
bodice so tightly that she could not breathe, and fell down upon the ground as
though she were dead. Now, said the queen, I am once more the most beautiful
lady in the land, and she went away.  When the dwarfs came home they were very
grieved to find their dear little Snow White lying upon the ground as though
she were dead. They lifted her gently and, seeing that she was too tightly
laced, cut the silken cord. She drew a long breath and then gradually came back
to life.  When the dwarfs heard all that had happened they said, The pedlar
woman was certainly the wicked queen. Now, take care in future that you open
the door to none when we are not with you.  The wicked queen had no sooner
reached home than she went to her mirror, and said, Mirror, mirror upon the
wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror answered as before, O
Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far to see. Over the hills
and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  The blood rushed to her face
as she heard these words, for she knew that Snow White must have come to life
again.  But I will manage to put an end to her yet, she said, and then by using
witchcraft, she made a poisonous comb.  Again she disguised herself, climbed
the seven mountains, and knocked at the door of the seven dwarfs cottage,
crying, Pretty things to sell - very cheap today!  Snow White looked out of the
window and said, Go away, good woman, for I dare not let you in.  "Surely you
can look at my goods," answered the woman, and held up the poisonous comb,
which pleased Snow White so well that she opened the door and bought it.  Come,
let me comb your hair in the newest way, said the woman, and the poor
unsuspicious child let her have her way, but no sooner did the comb touch her
hair than the poison began to work, and she fell fainting to the ground.
There, you model of beauty, said the wicked woman, as she went away. You are
done for at last!  Fortunately it was almost time for the dwarfs to come home,
and as soon as they came in and found Snow White lying upon the ground they
guessed that her wicked step mother had been there again, and set to work to
find out what was wrong.  They soon saw the poisonous comb, and drew it out of
her hair, and almost immediately Snow White began to recover, and told them
what had happened. Once more they warned her to be on her guard, and to open
the door to no one.  When the queen reached home, she went straight to the
mirror and said, Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?
The mirror answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, Snow White is fairer far
to see. Over the hills and far away, She dwells with seven dwarfs today.  When
the queen heard these words she shook with rage. Snow White shall die, she
cried, even if it costs me my own life!  She went into a secret chamber, where
no one else ever entered, and there she made a poisonous apple. She then
painted her face and disguised herself as a peasant woman, and climbed the
seven mountains and went to the dwarfs house.  She knocked at the door. Snow
White put her head out of the window, and said, I must not let anyone in; the
seven dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.  Its all the same to me, answered the
peasant woman, I shall soon get rid of these fine apples. But before I go Ill
make you a present of one.  Oh! No, said Snow White, for I must not take it.
Surely you are not afraid of poison? Said the woman. See, I will cut one in
two; the rosy cheek you shall take, and the white cheek I will eat myself.
Now, the apple had been so cleverly made that only the rose-cheeked side
contained the poison. Snow White longed for the delicious-looking fruit, and
when she saw that the woman ate half of it, she thought there could be no
danger, and stretched out her hand and took the other part. But no sooner had
she tasted it than she fell down dead.  The wicked queen laughed aloud with joy
as she gazed at her. White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony, she said.
This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you.  She went straight home and asked her
mirror, Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  At
length it answered, Thou, O Queen, art fairest of all!  So her envious heart
had peace - at least, as much as an envious heart can have peace.  When the
little dwarfs came home at night they found Snow White lying upon the ground.
No breath came from her parted lips, for she was dead. They lifted her tenderly
and sought for some poisonous object which might have caused the mischief,
unlaced her frock, combed her hair, and washed her with wine and water, but all
in vain - dead she was and dead she remained. They laid her upon a bier, and
all seven of them sat round about it, and wept as though their hearts would
break, for three whole days.  When the time came that she should be laid in the
ground they could not bear to part from her. Her pretty cheeks were still rosy
red, and she looked just as though she were still living.  We cannot hide her
away in the dark earth, said the dwarfs, and so they made a transparent coffin
of shining glass, laid her in it, and wrote her name upon it in letters of
gold; and that she was a kings daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the
mountain top, and one of them always stayed by it and watched it.  And birds
came too and wept for Snow White; first an owl, then a raven, and at last a
dove.  For a long, long time little Snow White lay in the coffin, but she did
not change; she only looked as though she slept, for she was still as white as
snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony.  It chanced that a kings son came
into the wood, and went to the dwarfs house, meaning to spend the night there.
He saw the coffin upon the mountain top, with little Snow White lying within
it, and he read the words that were written upon it in letters of gold.  He
said to the dwarfs, If you will but let me have the coffin, you may ask of me
what you will, and I will give it to you.  But the dwarfs answered, We would
not sell it for all the gold in the world.  Then said the prince, Let me have
it as a gift, I pray you - for I cannot live without seeing little Snow White,
and I will prize your gift as the dearest of my possessions.  The good little
dwarfs pitied him when they heard these words, and so gave him the coffin. The
kings son then bade his servants place it upon their shoulders and carry it
away, but as they went they stumbled over the stump of a tree, and the violent
shaking shook the piece of poisonous apple which had lodged in Snow Whites
throat out again, so that she opened her eyes, raised the lid of the coffin,
and sat up, alive once more.  Where am I? She cried, and the happy prince
answered, Thou art with me, dearest.  Then he told her all that had happened,
and how he loved her better than the whole world, and begged her to go with him
to his fathers palace and be his wife. Snow White agreed and went with him, and
the wedding was celebrated with great splendour and magnificence.  Little Snow
Whites wicked step mother was invited to the feast, and when she had dressed
herself in her most beautiful clothes, she stood before her mirror, and said,
Mirror, mirror upon the wall, who is the fairest fair of all?  And the mirror
answered, O Lady Queen, though fair ye be, The young queen is fairer to see.
Oh! How angry the wicked woman was then, and so terrified too, that she
scarcely knew what to do. At first she thought she would not go to the wedding
at all, but then she felt that she could not rest until she had seen the young
queen. No sooner did she enter the palace than she recognised little Snow
White, and could not move for terror.  Then a pair of red hot iron shoes was
brought into the room with tongs and set before her, and these she was forced
to put on and to dance in them until she could dance no longer, but fell down
dead, and that was the end of the wicked queen.

Title = The Gingerbread Man
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy. One
morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added
icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and
eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, "You
watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the
garden." So the old man and the old woman went out and began to dig potatoes,
and left the little boy to tend the oven. But he started to day dream, and
didnt watch it all of the time. All of a sudden he heard a noise, and he looked
up and the oven door popped open, and out of the oven jumped a gingerbread man,
and went rolling along end over end towards the open door of the house. The
little boy ran to shut the door, but the gingerbread man was too quick for him
and rolled through the door, down the steps, and out into the road long before
the little boy could catch him.  The little boy ran after him as fast as he
could manage, crying out to his grandfather and grandmother, who heard the
noise, and threw down their spades in the garden to give chase too. The
gingerbread man outran all three a long way, and was soon out of sight, while
they had to sit down, all out of breath, on a bank to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to two men digging a well who looked up
from their work and called out, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, and a little boy - and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well see about that?" Said they, and so they threw
down their picks and ran after him, but couldnt catch up with him, and soon
they had to sit down by the roadside to rest.  On ran the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to two men digging a ditch. "Where ye going, gingerbread
man?" said they.  He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
and two well diggers, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you? Well
see about that!" said they, and they too threw down their spades, and ran after
him. The gingerbread man soon outstripped them also, and seeing they could
never catch him, gave up the chase and sat down to rest.  On went the
gingerbread man, and by-and-by he came to a bear. The bear said, "Where are ye
going, gingerbread man?" He said, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a
little boy, two well diggers, and two ditch diggers, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Growled the bear. "Well see about that!" He
trotted as fast as his legs could carry him after the gingerbread man, who
never stopped to look behind him. Before long the bear was left so far behind
that he saw he might as well given up the hunt at the start, so he stretched
himself out by the roadside to rest.  On went the gingerbread man and by-and-by
he came to a wolf. The wolf said, "Where ye going, gingerbread man?" He said,
"Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two well diggers, two ditch
diggers, and a bear, and I can outrun you too-o-o!" "You can, can you?" Snarled
the wolf. "Well see about that!" So he set into a gallop after the gingerbread
man, who went on and on so fast, that the wolf too saw there was no hope of
overtaking him, and he too lay down to rest.  On went the gingerbread man, and
by-and-by he came to a fox that lay quietly in a corner of the fence. The fox
called out in a sharp voice, but without getting up, "Where ye going,
gingerbread man?" He said: "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy,
two well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear, and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o!" The fox said, "I cant quite hear you, gingerbread man. Wont you come
a little closer?" Turning his head a little to one side.  The gingerbread man
stopped his race for the first time, and went a little closer, and called out
in a very loud voice, "Ive outrun an old man, an old woman, a little boy, two
well diggers, two ditch diggers, a bear and a wolf, and I can outrun you
too-o-o." "I still cant quite hear you. Wont you come a little closer?" Said
the fox in a feeble voice, as he stretched out his neck towards the gingerbread
man, and put one paw behind his ear.  The gingerbread man came up close, and
leaning towards the fox, screamed out "IVE OUTRUN AN OLD MAN, AN OLD WOMAN, A
LITTLE BOY, TWO WELL DIGGERS, TWO DITCH DIGGERS, A BEAR AND A WOLF, AND I CAN
OUTRUN YOU TOO-O-O!" "You can, can you?" Yelped the fox, and he snapped up the
gingerbread man in his sharp teeth in the twinkling of an eye.

Title = Snow White and Red Rows
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = A poor widow once lived in a little cottage with a garden in front of
it, in which grew two rose trees, one bearing white roses and the other red.
She had two children, who were just like the two rose trees; one was called
Snow White and the other Rose Red, and they were the sweetest and best children
in the world: always hard working and cheerful. But Snow White was quieter and
more gentle than Rose Red. Rose Red loved to run about the fields and meadows,
and to pick flowers and catch butterflies. Snow White sat at home with her
mother and helped her in the household, or read aloud to her when there was no
work to do.  The two children loved each other so dearly that they always
walked about hand in hand, and when Snow White said, We will never desert each
other, Rose Red answered, No, not as long as we live, and the mother added,
Whatever one gets she shall share with the other. They often roamed about in
the woods gathering berries and no beast threatened to hurt them. In fact,
animals loved and trusted the two girls. The little hare would eat a cabbage
leaf from their hands, the deer grazed beside them, the stag would bound past
them merrily, and the birds remained on the branches and sang to them with all
their might.  No evil ever befell them; if they stayed late in the wood and
night overtook them, they lay down together on the moss and slept until
morning, and their mother knew they were quite safe, and never felt anxious
about them. Once, when they had slept all night in the wood and had been
wakened by the morning sun, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white robe
sitting close to their resting place. The figure got up, looked at them kindly,
but said nothing, and vanished into the wood. When they looked around them they
realised that they had slept quite close to a deep crater in the ground. If
they had gone a few steps further in the darkness, they would have fallen into
it. When they told their mother of their adventure, she said what they had seen
must have been the angel that guards good children.  Snow White and Rose Red
kept their mothers cottage so beautifully clean and neat that it was a pleasure
to go into it. In summer Rose Red looked after the house, and every morning
before her mother awoke she placed a bunch of flowers before the bed, from each
tree a rose. In winter Snow White lit the fire and put on the kettle, which was
made of brass, but so beautifully polished that it shone like gold. In the
evening when the snowflakes fell their mother said, Snow White, go and close
the shutters, and they drew round the fire, while the mother put on her
spectacles and read aloud from a big book and the two girls listened and sat
and spun. Beside them on the ground lay a little lamb, and behind them perched
a little white dove with its head tucked under its wings.  One evening as they
sat cosily together someone knocked at the door as though he wanted to come in.
The mother said, Rose Red, open the door quickly; it must be some traveller
seeking shelter. Rose Red hastened to unbar the door, and thought she saw a
poor man standing in the darkness outside - but it was no such thing - only a
bear, who poked his thick black head through the door. Rose Red screamed aloud
and sprang back in terror, the lamb began to bleat, the dove flapped its wings,
and Snow White ran and hid behind her mothers bed. The bear began to speak, and
said, Dont be afraid. I wont hurt you. I am half frozen, and only wish to warm
myself a little.  My poor bear, said the mother, lie down by the fire, only
take care you dont burn your fur. Then she called out, Snow White and Rose Red,
come out; the bear will do you no harm - he is a good, honest creature.  So
they both came out of their hiding places, and gradually the lamb and dove drew
near too, and they all forgot their fear. The bear asked the children to beat
the snow a little out of his fur, and they fetched a brush and scrubbed him
until he was dry. Then the beast stretched himself in front of the fire, and
growled quite happily and comfortably. The children soon grew quite at their
ease with him, and teased him and played with him quite roughly. They tugged
his fur with their hands, put their small feet on his back, and rolled him
about here and there, or took a hazel wand and beat him with it; and if he
growled they only laughed. The bear submitted to everything with the best
possible good nature, only when they went too far he cried, Oh! children, spare
my life!  Snow White and Rose Red, Do not beat your lover dead.  When it was
time to retire for the night, and the others went to bed, the mother said to
the bear, You can lie there on the hearth, in heavens name; it will be shelter
for you from the cold and wet.  As soon as day dawned the children led him out,
and he trotted over the snow into the wood. From this time on the bear came
every evening at the same hour, and lay down by the hearth and let the children
play what pranks they liked with him. They got so used to him that the door was
never shut until their friend had made his appearance.  When spring came, and
all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow White, Now I must go
away, and not return again the whole summer.  Where are you going to, dear
bear? Snow White asked. I must go to the wood and protect my treasure from the
wicked dwarfs. In winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are forced to
remain underground, for they cant work their way through; but now, when the sun
has thawed and warmed the ground, they break through and come up above to spy
the land and steal what they can. Anything that falls into their hands and into
their caves is not easily found again.  Snow White was quite sad that their
friend was leaving, and when she unbarred the door for him, the bear stepping
out, caught a piece of his fur in the door-knocker, and Snow White thought she
saw glittering gold beneath it, but she couldnt be certain of it. The bear ran
hastily away, and soon disappeared behind the trees.  A short time after this,
the mother sent the children into the wood to collect twigs to start the fire.
As they wandered, they came upon a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and
on the trunk among the long grass they noticed something jumping up and down,
but what it was they couldnt be certain. When they approached nearer they saw a
dwarf with a wizened face and a beard a yard long. The end of the beard was
jammed into a cleft of the tree, and the little man sprang about like a dog on
a chain, and didnt seem to know what he was to do. He glared at the girls with
his fiery red eyes, and screamed out, What are you standing there for? Cant you
come and help me?  What were you doing, little man? asked Rose Red.  You
stupid, inquisitive goose! Replied the dwarf. I wanted to split the tree to get
little chips of wood for our kitchen fire. My beautiful white beard has gotten
caught in a cleft, so here I am stuck fast, and I cant get away; and you silly,
smooth-faced, milk-and-water girls just stand and laugh! Ugh! What wretches you
are!  The children did all in their power, but they couldnt get the beard out -
it was wedged in far too firmly. I will run and fetch somebody, said Rose Red.
Crazy blockheads! Snapped the dwarf. Whats the good of calling anyone else?
Youre already two too many for me. Does nothing better occur to you than that?
Dont be so impatient, said Snow White, and taking her scissors out of her
pocket she cut off the end of his beard. As soon as the dwarf felt himself free
he seized a bag full of gold which was hidden among the roots of the tree,
lifted it up, and muttered aloud, Curse these rude wretches, cutting off a
piece of my splendid beard! With these words he swung the bag over his back,
and disappeared without as much as looking at the children again.  Shortly
after this Snow White and Rose Red were out again, walking along the bank of a
stream. They saw something which looked like an enormous grasshopper springing
toward the water as if it were going to jump in. They ran forward and
recognised their old friend the dwarf.  Where are you going to? Rose Red asked.
Youre surely not going to jump into the water?  Im not such a fool, screamed
the dwarf. Dont you see that cursed fish is trying to drag me in?  The little
man had been sitting on the bank, fishing, when unfortunately the wind had
entangled his beard in the line. Immediately afterward a big fish bit, and the
feeble little creature had no strength to pull it out. The fish dragged the
dwarf toward him. He clung on with all his might to every reed and blade of
grass.  The girls came up just in the nick of time, held him firm, and did all
they could to free his beard from the line; but in vain, beard and line were in
a hopeless muddle. All they could do was to take out the scissors again to cut
the beard.  The little man was far from grateful to the girls for rescuing him.
He yelled to them, Do you call that manners, you toadstools, to disfigure a
fellows face?  It wasnt enough that you shortened my beard before, but you must
now cut off the best bit of it.  Then he fetched a sack of pearls that lay
among the rushes, and without saying another word he dragged it away and
disappeared behind a stone.  It happened that soon after this the mother sent
the two girls to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their
road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there.
While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly
above them, but always swooping lower, until at last it settled on a rock not
far from them.  Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They
ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old
friend, the dwarf, and was about to carry him off. The tender-hearted children
seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last
he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he
screamed in his screeching voice, Couldnt you have treated me more carefully?
You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds!  Then he took a bag of
precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were used
to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On
their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf
pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one
would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering
stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood
still and gazed on them.  What are you standing gaping there for? Screamed the
dwarf, and his ashen-grey face became scarlet with rage. He was about to go off
with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted
out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadnt time to
escape down his hole, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in
terror, Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! Ill give you all my treasure. Look at those
beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! What pleasure would you
get from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You wont feel me between your
teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel
for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heavens sake. But the bear,
paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with
his paw, and he never moved again. The girls had run away, but the bear called
after them, Snow White and Rose Red, dont be afraid. Wait, and Ill come with
you. Then they recognised his voice and stood still, and when the bear was
quite close to them his skin suddenly fell off, and a beautiful man stood
beside them, all dressed in gold.  I am a kings son, he said, and have been
doomed by that unholy little dwarf, who had stolen my treasure, to roam about
the woods as a wild bear until his death should set me free. Now he has got his
well-merited punishment.  In due course, when the girls were old enough, Snow
White married the prince who had been a bear, and Rose Red - his brother, and
they divided the great treasure the dwarf had collected in his cave between
them. The old mother lived for many years peacefully with her children; and she
carried the two rose trees with her, and they stood in front of her window, and
every year they bore the finest red and white roses.

Title = Cinderalla
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and
most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had been married before, and already
had two daughters who were exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by
his first wife, a young daughter, but of unequalled goodness and sweetness of
temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.
This sweet little girl missed her mother, who had died, terribly much No sooner
was the wedding ceremony over, than the new wife began to show herself in her
true colours. She could not bear the goodness of the gentlemans pretty girl,
and especially as she made her own daughters appear the more horrid. She made
her do the meanest jobs in the house. The girl scoured the dishes and tables,
and scrubbed the stepmothers bathroom, and those of her daughters. She slept in
a little attic, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay upon beds with
the softest pillows, in fine rooms, with floors covered with beautiful carpets,
and walls on which hung looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves
at their full length from head to foot.  The poor girl bore all patiently, and
dared not tell her father, who would have been angry with her; for his new wife
ruled him entirely. When the little girl had done her work, she used to go into
the chimney corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which led her to be
called Cinderwench; but the youngest stepdaughter, who was not quite so rude
and unkind as the eldest, called her Cinderella. However, Cinderella, dressed
in rags was a hundred times prettier than her sisters, though they were always
dressed very richly.  It happened that the kings son gave a ball, and invited
all the finest gentlemen and ladies of the city. Our young misses were also
invited, for they were always to be seen at fashionable parties. They were
truly delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing such
gowns, petticoats, and headdresses as might suit them. This was a new trouble
to Cinderella, for it was she who washed and ironed her sisters clothes and got
all their things ready. Meanwhile, the sisters talked all day long of nothing
but what they should wear to the ball.  For my part, said the eldest, I will
wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.  And I, said the youngest, shall
have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my
gold-flowered gown, and my diamond belt, which is far from being the most
ordinary one in the world.  But in truth, they were still not absolutely sure
what would be best to wear to the ball, so they sent for the best fashion
designer they could find to advise on their evening dresses, and they had their
nails manicured at Mademoiselle de la Poche.  Cinderella was likewise called up
to them for advice, for she had excellent judgement, and advised them always
for the best, indeed, and offered her services to make up their hair, which
they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this, they said to her:
Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?  Alas! Said she. You only
jeer me. It is not for a poor girl like me to go there.  Youre quite right,
replied they, it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.
Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads all wrong, but she was
very good, and dressed them perfectly well.  The stepsisters were almost two
days without eating, so much were they thrilled and excited. They broke above a
dozen corsets in trying to be laced up tightly, so that they might have a fine
slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass. At last the
happy day came. They went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes
as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.
Just then, her fairy godmother, who used to watch over her secretly, saw her
all in tears, and appeared at her side and asked her what was the matter.  I
wish I could  I wish I could She was not able to speak the rest, being
interrupted by her tears and sobbing.  This fairy godmother of hers said to
her: You wish you could go to the ball; is it not so?  Y-es, cried Cinderella,
with a great sigh.  Well, said her godmother, be but a good girl, and I will
see that you shall go to the ball. Then she took her into her secret room, and
said to her: Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.  Cinderella went
immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her
godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the
ball. Her godmother scooped out all the inside of the big vegetable, leaving
nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin
was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.  She then
went to look into her mousetrap, where she found six mice, all alive, and
ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor. As each mouse went out,
she gave it a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned
into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a
beautiful mouse-coloured dapple-grey. But they still needed a coachman.  I will
go and see, said Cinderella, if there is a rat in the rattrap  we may make a
coachman of him.  Youre a smart one, replied her godmother, go and look.
Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats. The
fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and having
touched him with her wand, was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the
smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.  After that, she said to her: Go again into
the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering can, bring them
to me.  She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six
footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their uniforms all
bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they
had done nothing else their whole lives. The fairy then said to Cinderella:
Well, you have here transport fit to take you to the ball. Are you not pleased
with it?  Oh yes, cried she, but must I go there as I am, in these nasty rags?
Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and at the same instant, her
clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels. This
done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.
Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all
things, commanded her not to stay until after midnight, telling her at the same
time that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again,
her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes
become just as they were before.  She promised her godmother she would not fail
to leave the ball before midnight; and then away she went, scarce able to
contain herself for joy. The kings son who was told that a great princess, whom
nobody knew, was to come, ran out to receive her. He gave her his hand as she
alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.
There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the
violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular
beauty of the unknown newcomer.  Nothing was then heard but a confused noise
of: Ah! How lovely she is! Ah! How lovely she is!  The king himself, old as he
was, could not help watching her, and telling the queen softly that it was a
long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.  All the ladies
were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some
made the next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such
fine material and as able hands to make them.  The kings son led her to the
most honourable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him. She danced
so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her. A fine banquet was
served up, of which the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he
busied in gazing on her.  She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a
thousand polite gestures, giving them part of the oranges and lemon blossoms
which the prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for
they did not recognise her. While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she
heard the clock strike eleven and three quarters, whereupon she immediately
made a curtsy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.  When she
got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and after having thanked her, she
said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because
the kings son had desired her.  As she was eagerly telling her godmother
whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which
Cinderella ran and opened.  How long you have stayed! Cried she, gaping,
rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just woken out of
her sleep. She had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they
went from home.  If you had been at the ball, said one of her sisters, you
would not have been tired. There came there the finest princess, the most
beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes. She was a thousand times nice to us,
and gave us orange and lemon blossoms.  Cinderella seemed very indifferent in
the matter, indeed, she asked them the name of that princess, but they told her
they did not know it, and that the kings son was very uneasy on her account and
would give all the world to know who she was.  At this Cinderella, smiling,
replied: She must then be very beautiful indeed. How happy you have been! Could
not I see her? Ah! Dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes
which you wear everyday.  Aye, to be sure! Cried Miss Charlotte. Lend my
clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as you! I should be a fool.  Cinderella
indeed expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she
would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for
jokingly.  The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was
Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before. The kings son was
always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to
whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her
godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock
striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven. She then rose up
and fled, as nimble as a deer. The prince followed, but could not overtake her.
She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the prince took up most
carefully. She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes,
having nothing left of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to
that she dropped. The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen
a princess go out. They replied that they had seen nobody go out but a young
girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench
than a gentlewoman.  When the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderella
asked them if they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.
They told her yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve,
and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the
prettiest in the world, which the kings son had taken up; that he had done
nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he
was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.
What they said was very true, for a few days after the kings son commanded it
to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry the young woman
whose foot would perfectly fit the slipper. He sent out his most trusted
advisers from the palace, who began to try it upon the princesses, then the
duchesses and all the court, but in vain. It was then brought to the two
sisters, who each did all that she possibly could to thrust her foot into the
slipper, but neither sister could manage to do so. Cinderella, who saw all
this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing: Let me see if it will not
fit me.  Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to tease her. The
gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and
finding her very handsome, said it was only right that she should try, and that
he had orders to let every girl try.  He asked Cinderella to sit down, and
putting the slipper to her foot, found it went on very easily, and fitted her
as if it had been made of wax. The astonishment her two sisters were in was
excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of
her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot. Thereupon, in came her
godmother, who having touched with her wand Cinderellas clothes, made them
richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.  Now her two
sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the
ball. They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill treatment
they had dished out to her. Cinderella took them up, and as she embraced them,
cried that she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love
her.  She was brought by carriage to the young prince, dressed as she was. He
thought her more charming than ever, and a few days after, married her.
Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters rooms in
the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the
court.

Title = The Boy Who Cried Wolf
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = When I was a lad, my father used to send me out to the fields each day to watch
over his sheep. Hey now! There are worse jobs than sitting out in the fresh air
all day, but it was boring work for a lad. I longed to be running around with
my friends, playing ball, or making boyish mischief.  Cant the sheep look after
themselves? I asked my father. After all, they know how to bleat and munch
grass, but there isnt much else that they do.  Father said it was important
work, and most importantly of all, I must keep my eyes peeled for the wolf  in
case he came sneaking into the fields and grabbed one of the spring lambs.  I
couldnt even go to sleep. I had to sit and keep a sharp look out. After a few
weeks of this, I got so bored that I began to wish that the wolf would show up
and give me something to do.  Then I got thinking to myself: Lets liven things
up a bit, I thought. Lets play a trick on the villagers. So I got up and ran as
fast as I could into the village shouting at the top of my voice: Wolf! Wolf!
WOOOOOOOOLF!  The villagers grabbed sticks, rolling pins, and pitchforks and
came running up to the field to chase away the wolf.  But when they got there,
all was peaceful. The lambs were frolicking as usual, quite unmolested.  I
laughed: Ha ha! Fooled you all!  None of the villagers laughed with me. Some of
them grumbled and the blacksmith became quite angry and shouted at me  but he
was just a bad sport who couldnt see the funny side of my joke.  A week later I
did the same thing again, only this time I put on an even better act. I daubed
red paint on my arm, and pretended that the wolf had bitten me.  This fooled
even the blacksmith, who was on his guard after the last trick I had played.
When they all arrived breathless in the field, I again called out: Ha ha!
Fooled you!  This time, quite a few of the villagers were angry with me, and I
got quite an ear-wigging from the blacksmith, the teacher, and the iron-monger.
When I got home, my father was furious and told me that I had a stupid sense of
humour.  But I thought it was funny  and so did my friends.  About a week after
that, I was sitting up on the hill watching my fathers sheep as usual. It was
getting on for evening, and the sun was setting behind the forest. I would have
to spend the night out there, and oh, how lonely and bored was I. Then all of a
sudden the sheep dogs started to bark and the flock was running around and
bleating like they had all gone mad. Only they hadnt; there was a wolf among
the sheep and he had seized a lamb.  Wolf! Wolf! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLF! I called
out and I ran into the village to get help.  But nobody came. Not one villager.
They carried on doing whatever they were doing. Eating supper, drinking ale, or
finishing off their work for the day.  Please, I said to the blacksmith. This
time its true. There really is a wolf.  But he just shrugged his shoulders.
You see nobody believes a liar, even when hes speaking the truth And thats why
you should never cry wolf unless you really mean it.

Quote = Mr. Fox was strolling through the woods when he noticed a plump hen sitting on
the branch of a tree.  Ah, he said to himself. Lunch. But he did not say that
aloud. No, he was far too cunning to show what he was really thinking. Instead,
he said, Good day to you, my lovely lady. May the angel of peace be upon you.
May your spirit be uplifted with joy.  Good day to you, clucked back the hen.
Have you strayed from the farmyard? enquired the fox.  I have, replied the hen.
I had to leave, you see. Cluck! Im afraid that the farmers wife is no honest
woman. She kept on stealing my eggs. Cl-uuuck!  One day, I noticed a hole in
the fence. I decided to pop through it, and make my own way in the world.
Cluck!  A hole in the fence, you say? asked Mr. Fox.  Cluck, indeed, said the
hen.  And Mr. Fox made a quiet note of that piece of information. However,
right then, he had more pressing business to attend to.  And how do you like
living on your own? he enquired. Do you not miss the warm bosom of friendship?
Cluck! On the whole, I enjoy my own company, she replied, but of course one has
to look out for tricky animals. Cluck! who would like to have me for their
lunch. Cluck! Cluck!  Have you for their lunch, you say? laughed Mr. Fox.
Darling, thats so last year! Havent you heard the news? We animals have seen
the light. We have surrendered to the Power of Love, and we have signed an
online Manifesto of Peace. Its gone viral, dont you know? Yes, the days of
eating one another are absolutely over. Meat is totally off the menu. And
nobody misses it, not one tiny, tender, tasty bit. The new in-diet is
vegetarianism. Why, even the owl has quit a life-long habit of eating mice, and
now lives on sunflower seeds.  She feels so much better for it. And ever since
the wolf found inner-tranquility through mindfulness and meditation, he has
realised that he just LOVES turnips for dinner. As for myself, Im rather
partial to a slither of red, succulent, raw beetroot. Indeed, we animals are on
a spiritual journey. We have learned that the only true things in this universe
are - Love, Peace and Friendship. Share the memes. Make Love not War! Practice
the Power of Now! Eat up your Veggies!  Cluck, said the hen. A Manifesto of
Peace, you say. Thats news to me.  Well, cluck on down, and Ill clue you in,
said Mr. Fox, trying not to lick his lips. You cant roast, I mean roost, up in
that tree until you are past your sell-by-date. What a waste! And what a girth!
Join me. We shall be best mates.  Let us walk in the woods, you and I, and talk
to the most spiritual and fascinating animals. They all know me, and have a
deep respect for my soul. Im so full of love. It just gushes out of me.  But
the hen said nothing. She uttered not one cluck. Instead, she stared silently
into the distance.  Come, come, said Mr Fox. The time to meditate is before
breakfast. Right now, well, its practically lunchtime.  Cluck, Im not
meditating, said the hen. Im looking out from my vantage point.  And what do
you know? Cl-uuck? I see a pack of hunting dogs, and theyre heading this way.
A pack of hunting dogs, you say, said Mr. Fox. Right-oh, thanks for the
tip-off. Ill make myself scarce.  Cluck cluck. Whats there to be frightened of?
Didnt you just say that Love and Peace have broken out amongst the animals?
Ill tell you more about that later, said Mr. Fox scampering off. The dogs
havent heard about it, yet. They're not on Facebook.  And with that, he was
gone. And so it seems that the hen wasnt so dim after all. She was right to be
wary of a sudden offer of friendship - and of people who are full of slick
slogans about love and peace, at least until they have shown that they practice
what they preach.  And Bertie says that you should be wary of charming
charlatans too.

Title = The Ugly Duckling
Author = Hans Christian Andersen
Quote = It was summer in the land of Denmark, and though for most of the year
the country looks flat and ugly, it was beautiful now. The wheat was yellow,
the oats were green, the hay was dry and delicious to roll in, and from the old
ruined house which nobody lived in, down to the edge of the canal, was a forest
of prickly plants called burdocks so tall that a whole family of children might
have dwelt in them and never have been found out.  It was under these burdocks
that a duck had built herself a warm nest, and was not sitting all day on six
pretty eggs. Five of them were white, but the sixth, which was larger than the
others, was of an ugly grey colour. The duck was always puzzled about that egg,
and how it came to be so different from the rest. Other birds might have
thought that when the duck went down in the morning and evening to the water to
stretch her legs in a good swim, some lazy mother might have been on the
lookout , and have popped her egg into the nest. But ducks are not clever at
all, and are not quick at counting, so this duck did not worry herself about
the matter, but just took care that the big egg should be as warm as the rest.
This was the first set of eggs that the duck had ever laid, and, to begin with,
she was very pleased and proud, and laughed at the other mothers, who were
always neglecting their duties to gossip with each other or to take little
extra swims besides the two in the morning and evening that were necessary for
health. But at length she grew tired of sitting there all day. My eggs are
taking too long to hatch,' she said to herself; and she pined for a little
amusement also.  Still, she knew that if she left her eggs and the ducklings in
them to die, none of her friends would ever speak to her again; so there she
stayed, only getting off the eggs several times a day to see if the shells were
cracking--which may have been the very reason why they did not crack sooner.
She had looked at the eggs at least a hundred and fifty times, when, to her
joy, she saw a tiny crack on two of them, and scrambling back to the nest she
drew the eggs closer the one to the other, and never moved for the whole of
that day. Next morning she was rewarded by noticing cracks in the whole five
eggs, and by midday two little yellow heads were poking out from the shells.
This encouraged her so much that, after breaking the shells with her bill, so
that the little creatures could get free of them, she sat steadily for a whole
night upon the nest, and before the sun arose the five white eggs were empty,
and ten pairs of eyes were gazing out upon the green world.  Now the duck had
been carefully brought up, and did not like dirt, and, besides, broken shells
are not at all comfortable things to sit or walk upon; so she pushed the rest
out over the side, and felt delighted to have some company to talk to till the
big egg hatched. But day after day went on, and the big egg showed no signs of
cracking, and the duck grew more and more impatient, and began to wish she
could ask the advice of her husband, but he was never around when she needed
him.  'I can't think what is the matter with it,' the duck grumbled to her
neighbour who had called in to pay her a visit. 'Why I could have hatched two
broods in the time that this one has taken!' 'Let me look at it,' said the old
neighbour. 'Ah, I thought so; it is a turkey's egg. Once, when I was young,
they tricked me to sitting on a brood of turkey's eggs myself, and when they
were hatched the creatures were so stupid that nothing would make them learn to
swim. I have no patience when I think of it.' 'Well, I will give it another
chance,' sighed the duck, 'and if it does not come out of its shell in another
twenty-four hours, I will just leave it alone and teach the rest of them to
swim properly and to find their own food. I really can't be expected to do two
things at once.' And with a fluff of her feathers she pushed the egg into the
middle of the nest.  All through the next day she sat on, giving up even her
morning bath for fear that a blast of cold might strike the big egg. In the
evening, when she ventured to peep, she thought she saw a tiny crack in the
upper part of the shell. Filled with hope, she went back to her duties, though
she could hardly sleep all night for excitement. When she woke with the first
steaks of light she felt something stirring under her. Yes, there it was at
last; and as she moved, a big awkward bird tumbled head foremost on the ground.
There was no denying it was ugly, even the mother was forced to admit that to
herself, though she only said it was 'large' and 'strong.' 'You won't need any
teaching when you are once in the water,' she told him, with a glance of
surprise at the dull brown which covered his back, and at his long naked neck.
And indeed he did not, though he was not half so pretty to look at as the
little yellow balls that followed her.  When they returned they found the old
neighbour on the bank waiting for them to take them into the duckyard. 'No, it
is not a young turkey, certainly,' whispered she in confidence to the mother,
'for though it is lean and skinny, and has no colour to speak of, yet there is
something rather distinguished about it, and it holds its head up well.' 'It is
very kind of you to say so,' answered the mother, who by this time had some
secret doubts of its loveliness. 'Of course, when you see it by itself it is
all right, though it is different, somehow, from the others. But one cannot
expect all one's children to be beautiful!' By this time they had reached the
centre of the yard, where a very old duck was sitting, who was treated with
great respect by all the birds who lived on the water.  'You must go up and bow
low before her,' whispered the mother to her children, nodding her head in the
direction of the old lady, 'and keep your legs well apart, as you see me do. No
well-bred duckling turns in its toes. It is a sign of common parents.' The
little ducks tried hard to make their small fat bodies copy the movements of
their mother, and the old lady was quite pleased with them; but the rest of the
ducks looked on feeling annoyed, and one duck in particular said: 'Oh, dear me,
here are ever so many more little ducks! The yard is full already; and did you
ever see anything quite as ugly as that great tall creature? He is a disgrace
to any brood. I shall go and chase him out!' So saying she put up her feathers,
and running to the big duckling bit his neck.  The duckling gave a loud quack;
it was the first time he had felt any pain, and at the sound his mother turned
quickly.  'Leave him alone,' she said fiercely, 'or I will send for his father.
He was not bother you.' 'No; but he is so ugly and awkward no one can put up
with him,' answered the stranger. And though the duckling did not understand
the meaning of the words, he felt he was being blamed, and became more
uncomfortable still when the old Spanish duck who ruled the yard butted in: 'It
certainly is a great pity he is so different from these beautiful darlings. If
he could only be hatched over again!' The poor little fellow drooped his head,
and did not know where to look, but was comforted when his mother answered: 'He
may not be quite as handsome as the others, but he swims better, and is very
strong; I am sure he will make his way in the world as well as anybody.' 'Well,
you must feel quite at home here,' said the old duck waddling off. And so they
did, all except the duckling, who was snapped at by everyone when they thought
his mother was not looking. Even the turkey-cockerel, who was so big, never
passed him without mocking words, and his brothers and sisters, who would not
have noticed any difference unless it had been put into their heads, soon
became as rude and unkind as the rest.  At last he could bear it no longer, and
one day he fancied he saw signs of his mother turning against him too; so that
night, when the ducks and hens were still asleep, he stole away through an open
door, and under cover of the burdock leaves scrambled on by the bank of the
canal, till he reached a wide grassy moor, full of soft marshy places where the
reeds grew. Here he lay down, but he was too tired and too frightened to fall
asleep, and with the earliest peep of the sun the reeds began to rustle, and he
saw that he had blundered into a colony of wild ducks. But as he could not run
away again he stood up and bowed politely.  'You are ugly,' said the wild
ducks, when they had looked him well over; 'but, however, it is no business of
ours, unless you wish to marry one of our daughters, and that we should not
allow.' And the duckling answered that he had no idea of marrying anybody, and
wanted nothing but to be left alone after his long journey.  So for two whole
days he lay quietly among the reeds, eating such food as he could find, and
drinking the water of the moorland pool, till he felt himself quite strong
again. He wished he might stay were he was for ever, he was so comfortable and
happy, away from everyone, with nobody to bite him and tell him how ugly he
was.  He was thinking these thoughts, when two young geese caught sight of him
as they were having their evening splash among the reeds, looking for their
supper.  'We are getting tired of this moor,' they said, 'and to-morrow we
think of trying another, where the lakes are larger and the feeding better.
Will you come with us?' 'Is it nicer than this?' asked the duckling doubtfully.
And the words were hardly out of his mouth, when 'Pif! pah!' and the two new-
comers were stretched dead beside him.  At the sound of the gun the wild ducks
in the rushes flew into the air, and for a few minutes the firing continued as
the huntsmen aimed at the flying birds.  Luckily for himself the duckling could
not fly, and he floundered along through the water till he could hide himself
amidst some tall ferns which grew in a hollow. But before he got there he met a
huge creature on four legs, which soon realized was dog, who stood and gazed at
him with a long red tongue hanging out of his mouth. The duckling grew cold
with terror, and tried to hide his head beneath his little wings; but the dog
snuffed at him and passed on, and he was able to reach into his hiding place.
'I am too ugly even for a dog to eat,' said he to himself. 'Well, that is a
great mercy.' And he curled himself up in the soft grass till the shots died
away in the distance.  When all had been quiet for a long time, and there were
only stars to see him, he crept out and looked about him.  He would never go
near a pool again, never, thought he; and seeing that the moor stretched far
away in the opposite direction from which he had come, he marched bravely on
till he got to a small cottage, which seemed too tumbledown for the stones to
hold together many hours longer. Even the door only hung upon one hinge, and as
the only light in the room sprang from a tiny fire, the duckling edged himself
cautiously in, and lay down under a chair close to the broken door, from which
he could get out if necessary. But no one seemed to see him or smell him; so he
spend the rest of the night in peace.  Now in the cottage there lived an old
woman, her cat, and a hen; and it was really they, and not she, who were
masters of the house. The old woman, who passed all her days in spinning yarn,
which she sold at the nearest town, loved both the cat and the hen as her own
children, and never did anything they didnt want in any way; so it was them,
not her, that the duckling had to ask for a favour.  It was only next morning,
when it grew light, that they noticed their visitor, who stood trembling before
them, with his eye on the door ready to escape at any moment. They did not,
however, appear very fierce, and the duckling became less afraid as they
approached him.  'Can you lay eggs?' asked the hen. And the duckling answered
meekly: 'No; I don't know how.' Upon which the hen turned her back, and the cat
came forward.  'Can you ruffle your fur when you are angry, or purr when you
are pleased?' said she. And again the duckling had to admit that he could do
nothing but swim, which did not seem of much use to anybody.  So the cat and
the hen went straight off to the old woman, who was still in bed.  'Such a
useless creature has taken refuge here,' they said. 'It calls itself a
duckling; but it can neither lay eggs nor purr! What had we better do with it?'
'Keep it, to be sure!' replied the old woman briskly. 'It is all nonsense about
it not laying eggs. Anyway, we will let it stay here for a bit, and see what
happens.' So the duckling remained for three weeks, and shared the food of the
cat and the hen; but nothing in the way of eggs happened at all. Then the sun
came out, and the air grew soft, and the duckling grew tired of being in a hut,
and wanted with all his might to have a swim. And one morning he got so
restless that even his friends noticed it.  'What is the matter?' asked the
hen; and the duckling told her.  'I am so longing for the water again. You
can't think how delicious it is to put your head under the water and dive
straight to the bottom.' 'I don't think I should enjoy it,' replied the hen
doubtfully. 'And I don't think the cat would like it either.' And the cat, when
asked, agreed there was nothing she would hate so much.  'I can't stay here any
longer, I Must get to the water,' repeated the duck. And the cat and the hen,
who felt hurt and offended, answered shortly: 'Very well then, go.' The
duckling would have liked to say good- bye, and thank them for their kindness,
as he was polite by nature; but they had both turned their backs on him, so he
went out of the rickety door feeling rather sad. But, in spite of himself, he
could not help a thrill of joy when he was out in the air and water once more,
and cared little for the rude glances of the creatures he met. For a while he
was quite happy and content; but soon the winter came on, and snow began to
fall, and everything to grow very wet and uncomfortable. And the duckling soon
found that it is one thing to enjoy being in the water, and quite another to
like being damp on land.  The sun was setting one day, like a great scarlet
globe, and the river, to the duckling's vast bewilderment, was getting hard and
slippery, when he heard a sound of whirring wings, and high up in the air a
flock of swans were flying. They were as white as snow which had fallen during
the night, and their long necks with yellow bills were stretched to a land
where the sun shone all day. Oh, if he only could have gone with them! But that
was not possible, of course; and besides, what sort of companion could an ugly
thing like him be to those beautiful beings? So he walked sadly down to a
sheltered pool and dived to the very bottom, and tried to think it was the
greatest happiness he could dream of. But, all the same, he knew it wasn't!
And every morning it grew colder and colder, and the duckling had hard work to
keep himself warm. Indeed, it would be truer to say that he never was warm at
all; and at last, after one bitter night, his legs moved so slowly that the ice
crept closer and closer, and when the morning light broke he was caught fast,
as in a trap; and soon his senses went from him.  A few hours more and the poor
duckling's life had been ended. But, by good fortune, a man was crossing the
river on his way to his work, and saw in a moment what had happened. He had on
thick wooden shoes, and he went and stamped so hard on the ice that it broke,
and then he picked up the duckling and tucked him under his sheepskin coat,
where his frozen bones began to thaw a little.Instead of going on his work, the
man turned back and took the bird to his children, who gave him a warm mess to
eat and put him in a box by the fire, and when they came back from school he
was much more comfortable than he had been since he had left the old woman's
cottage.  They were kind little children, and wanted to play with him; but,
alas! the poor fellow had never played in his life, and thought they wanted to
tease him, and flew straight into the milk-pan, and then into the butter-dish,
and from that into the meal- barrel, and at last, terrified at the noise and
confusion, right out of the door, and hid himself in the snow amongst the
bushes at the back of the house.  He never could tell afterwards exactly how he
had spent the rest of the winter. He only knew that he was very miserable and
that he never had enough to eat. But by-and-by things grew better. The earth
became softer, the sun hotter, the birds sang, and the flowers once more
appeared in the grass. When he stood up, he felt different, somehow, from what
he had done before he fell asleep among the reeds to which he had wandered
after he had escaped from the peasant's hut. His body seemed larger, and his
wings stronger. Something pink looked at him from the side of a hill. He
thought he would fly towards it and see what it was.  Oh, how glorious it felt
to be rushing through the air, wheeling first one way and then the other! He
had never thought that flying could be like that! The duckling was almost sorry
when he drew near the pink cloud and found it was made up of apple blossoms
growing beside a cottage whose garden ran down to the banks of the canal. He
fluttered slowly to the ground and paused for a few minutes under a thicket of
syringas, and while he was gazing about him, there walked slowly past a flock
of the same beautiful birds he had seen so many months ago.  Fascinated, he
watched them one by one step into the canal, and float quietly upon the waters
as if they were part of them.  'I will follow them,' said the duckling to
himself; 'ugly though I am, I would rather be killed by them than suffer all I
have suffered from cold and hunger, and from the ducks and fowls who should
have treated me kindly.' And flying quickly down to the water, he swam after
them as fast as he could.  It did not take him long to reach them, for they had
stopped to rest in a green pool shaded by a tree whose branches swept the
water. And directly they saw him coming some of the younger ones swam out to
meet him with cries of welcome, which again the duckling hardly understood.  He
approached them glad, yet trembling, and turning to one of the older birds, who
by this time had left the shade of the tree, he said: 'If I am to die, I would
rather you should kill me. I don't know why I was ever hatched, for I am too
ugly to live.' And as he spoke, he bowed his head and looked down into the
water.  Reflected in the still pool he saw many white shapes, with long necks
and golden bills, and, without thinking, he looked for the dull grey body and
the awkward skinny neck. But no such thing was there.  Instead, he beheld
beneath him a beautiful white swan!  'The new one is the best of all,' said the
children when they came down to feed the swans with biscuit and cake before
going to bed. 'His feathers are whiter and his beak more golden than the rest.'
And when he heard that, the duckling thought that it was worth while having
undergone all the persecution and loneliness that he had passed through, as
otherwise he would never have known what it was to be really happy.

Title = The Golden Fish
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close
by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one
day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and
watching his line, all of a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the
water. When he reeled in his line, he pulled out a golden fish. But the fish
said, "Pray let me live! I am not a real fish. I am an enchanted prince. Put me
in the water again, and let me go!" "Oh, ho!" Said the man. "You need not go on
much more about the matter. I will have nothing to do with a fish that can
talk, so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!" Then he put him back into the
water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak
of blood behind him on the wave.  When the fisherman went home to his wife in
the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a golden fish, and how it had told
him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go
again. "Did not you ask it for anything?" Said the wife. "We live very
wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty. Do go back and tell the fish we
want a snug little cottage." The fisherman did not much like the business -
however, he went to the seashore, and when he got back there the water looked
all yellow and green. He stood at the waters edge, and said, "O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to
beg a gift of thee!" Then the fish came swimming to him and said, "Well, what
is her will? What does your wife want?" "Ah!" Said the fisherman. "She says
that when I caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let
you go. She does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug
little cottage." "Go home then," said the fish, "she is in the cottage
already!" So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice
trim little cottage.  "Come in, come in!" Said she. "Is not this much better
than the filthy pigsty we had?" There was a parlour, a bedroom, and a kitchen;
and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of
flowers and fruits. There was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman, "How happily we shall live now!" "We will try to do
so, at least," said his wife.  Everything went right for a week or two, and
then Dame Ilsabill said, "Husband, there is not nearly room enough for us in
this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small. I should
like to have a large stone castle to live in. Go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle." "Wife," said the fisherman, "I dont like to go to him
again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty
cottage to live in." "Nonsense!" Said the wife. "He will do it very willingly,
I know. Go along and try!" The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy:
and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very
calm. He went close to the edge of the waves, and said, "O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to
beg a gift of thee!" "Well, what does she want now?" said the fish.  "Ah!" Said
the man, dolefully. "My wife wants to live in a stone castle." "Go home then,"
said the fish, "she is standing at the gate of it already." So away went the
fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle.
"See," said she, "is not this grand?" With that they went into the castle
together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly
furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables. Behind the castle was a
garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, goats, hares,
and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow houses.  "Well," said the
man, "now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest
of our lives." "Perhaps we may," said the wife, "but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that." So they went to bed.The next morning when
Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with
her elbow, and said, "Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king
of all the land." "Wife, wife," said the man, "why should we wish to be the
king? I will not be king." "Then I will," said she. "But wife," said the
fisherman, "how can you be king? The fish cannot make you a king?" "Husband,"
said she, "say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king." So the man
went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This
time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves
and the ridges of foam as he cried out, "O man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My
wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"
"Well, what would she have now?" Said the fish. "Alas!" Said the poor man. "My
wife wants to be king." "Go home," said the fish, "she is king already." Then
the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of
soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. When he went in he saw his
wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her
head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than
the other.  "Well, wife," said the fisherman, "are you king?" "Yes," said she,
"I am king." And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, "Ah, wife!
what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to
wish for as long as we live." "I dont know how that may be," said she. "Never
is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I
think I should like to be emperor." "Alas, wife! Why should you wish to be
emperor?" Said the fisherman. "Husband," said she, "go to the fish! I say I
will be emperor." "Ah, wife!" Replied the fisherman. "The fish cannot make an
emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing." "I am
king," said Ilsabill, "and you are my slave - so go at once!" So the fisherman
was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good,
it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be
sorry for what we have done." He soon came to the seashore; and the water was
quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled
them about, but he went as near as he could to the waters brink, and said, "O
man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And
hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What would she have now?" Said the fish.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman, "she wants to be emperor." "Go home," said the fish,
"she is emperor already. "So he went home again, and as he came near he saw his
wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great
crown on her head a full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her
guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other - from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. Before her stood
princes, dukes, and earls. The fisherman went up to her and said, "Wife, are
you emperor?" "Yes," said she, "I am emperor." "Ah!" Said the man, as he gazed
upon her. "What a fine thing it is to be emperor!" "Husband," said she, "why
should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next." "O wife, wife!" Said he,
"How can you be pope? There is but one pope at a time in Christendom."
"Husband," said she, "I will be pope this very day." "But," replied the
husband, "the fish cannot make you pope." "What nonsense!" Said she. "If he can
make an emperor, he can make a pope - go and try him." So the fisherman went.
But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and
down in boiling waves. The ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the
tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of
blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising.
At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that
his knees knocked together. Still he went down near to the shore, and said, "O
man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife Ilsabill Will have her own will, And
hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What does she want now?" said the fish.
"Ah!" Said the fisherman. "My wife wants to be pope." "Go home," said the fish;
"she is pope already." Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting
on a throne that was two miles high. She had three great crowns on her head,
and around her stood all the pomp and power of the church. On each side of her
were two rows of burning lights of all sizes; the greatest as large as the
highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small
rush light. "Wife," said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness,
"are you pope?" "Yes," said she, "I am pope." "Well, wife," replied he, "it is
a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing
greater." "I will think about that," said the wife. Then they went to bed, but
Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next.
At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. "Ha!"
Thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window. "After all I
cannot prevent the sun rising." At this thought she was very angry, and wakened
her husband, and said, "Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of
the sun and moon." The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened
him so much that he started and fell out of bed. "Alas, wife! Cannot you be
easy with being pope?" "No," said she, "I am very uneasy as long as the sun and
moon rise without my permission. Go to the fish at once!" Then the man went
shivering with fear, and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm
arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. All the heavens became black
with stormy clouds, and the lightning played, and the thunders rolled. You
might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with
crowns of white foam upon their heads. The fisherman crept towards the sea, and
cried out, as well as he could, "O man of the sea!  Hearken to me!  My wife
Ilsabill Will have her own will, And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!" "What
does she want now?" Said the fish. "Ah!" Said he. "She wants to be lord of the
sun and moon." "Go home," said the fish, "to your pigsty again." And there they
live to this very day.

Title = The Town Musicians of Bremen
Author = Brothers Grimm
Quote = A certain man had a donkey, which had carried the corn sacks to the
mill loyally for many a long year; but his strength was going, and he was
growing more and more unfit for work. His master began to wonder if it was
worth his while by keeping this old donkey much longer.  The donkey, seeing
that no good wind was blowing, ran away and set out on the road to Bremen.
There, he thought, I can surely be town musician.  When he had walked some
distance, he found a dog lying on the road, gasping like one who had run until
he was tired. What are you gasping so for, you big fellow? Asked the donkey.
Ah, replied the dog, as I am old, and grow weaker daily; I can no longer hunt.
My master wanted to kill me, so I ran away, but now how am I to earn my bread?
Ill tell you what, said the donkey, I am going to Bremen, and shall be a town
musician there; come with me and work also as a musician. I will play the lute,
and you shall beat the kettledrum.  Old cat joins town musicians The dog
agreed, and so on they went. Not before long they came to a cat, sitting on the
path with a face like three rainy days!  Now then, old fluff and claws, what
has gone so wrong with you? Asked the donkey.  Who can be merry when his neck
is in danger? Answered the cat. Because I am now getting old, my teeth are worn
to stumps, and I prefer to sit by the fire and spin, rather than hunt about
after mice. My mistress wanted to drown me, so I ran away. Now good advice is
scarce. Where am I to go?  Go with us to Bremen. You understand night music so
you can be a town musician.  The cat thought well of it and decided to go with
them. After this the three runaways came to a farmyard, where the cockerel was
sitting upon the gate, cock-a-doodle-doing with all his might. Your
cock-a-doodle-do goes through and through my skull, said the donkey. What is
the matter?  Guests are coming on Sunday and the housewife has no pity, said
the cockerel, and has told the cook that she intends to eat me in the soup
tomorrow, and this evening I am to have my head cut off. Now I am
cock-a-doodle-doing at full pitch while I can.  Ah you red-headed bird, said
the donkey, you had better come away with us. We are going to Bremen; you can
find something better than death everywhere. You have a good voice, and if we
make music together it must have some quality!  The cockerel agreed to this
plan, and all four went on together. They could not, however, reach the city of
Bremen in one day, and in the evening they came to a forest where they meant to
pass the night. The donkey and the dog laid themselves down under a large tree,
the cat and cockerel settled themselves in the branches  but the cockerel flew
right to the top, where he was most safe.  Before he went to sleep, he called
out to his companions that there must be a house not far off, for he saw a
light. The donkey said: If so, we had better get up and go on, for the shelter
here is bad. The dog thought that a few bones with some meat on would do him
good too!  So they moved further on, and soon saw the light shine brighter and
grow larger, until they came to a well lit robbers house. The donkey, as the
biggest, went to the window and looked in: What do you see, my grey horse?
Asked the cockerel. What do I see? Answered the donkey. A table covered with
good things to eat and drink, and robbers sitting at it enjoying themselves.
That would be just the sort of thing for us, said the cockerel. Yes, yes. Ah,
how I wish we were there! Said the donkey.  Then the animals put their heads
together and schemed how to best win an invitation to come inside and join the
robbers at the table.  Come, come my friends, said the donkey. We are
musicians, so let us sing for our supper.  They began to perform their music
together: The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cockerel
cock-a-doodle-doed. Then they burst through the window into the room, so that
the glass clattered! At this horrible din, the robbers sprang up, thinking no
otherwise than a ghost had come in, and they fled in a great fright out into
the forest. The four companions now sat down at the table, well content with
what was left, and ate as if they were going to fast for a month.  As soon as
the four musicians had done, they put out the light, and each found a sleeping
place according to his nature and to what suited him. The donkey laid himself
down upon some straw in the yard, the dog behind the door, the cat upon the
hearth near the warm ashes, and the cockerel perched himself upon a beam of the
roof; and being tired from their long walk, they soon went to sleep.  When it
was past midnight, the robbers saw from afar that the light was no longer
burning in their house. Appearing quiet, the captain said: We ought not to have
let ourselves be frightened out of our wits, and ordered one of them to go and
examine the house.  The messenger finding all was still, went into the kitchen
to light a candle, and taking the glistening fiery eyes of the cat for burning
coals, he held the candle to them to light it. The cat did not understand what
he meant to do, however, and flew in his face, spitting and scratching. He was
dreadfully frightened, and ran to the back door, but the dog, who lay there
sprang up and bit his leg. As he ran across the yard by the straw heap, the
donkey gave him a smart kick with its hind foot. The cockerel too, who had been
awakened by the noise, had become lively, and cried down from the beam,
Cock-a-doodle-doo!  Then the robber ran back as fast as he could to his captain
and said: Ah, there is a horrible witch sitting in the house, who spat on me
and scratched my face with her long claws; and by the door stands a man with a
knife who stabbed me in the leg, and in the yard there lies a monster who beat
me with a wooden club. Above, upon the roof, sits the judge, who called out:
Bring the rogue here to me! So I got away as well as I could.  After this the
robbers did not trust themselves in the house again; but it suited the four
musicians of Bremen so well that they did not care to leave it anymore.

Title = The Wicked Prince
Author = Hans Christian Andersen
Quote = THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were
set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the
people. He devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers
trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants huts by fire, so
that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung
dried up on the singed black trees. Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in
her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the
soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served as new nourishment
to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse
things than these soldiers! The prince was of opinion that all this was right,
and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take. His power
increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his
deeds.  He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually
accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled. He erected
magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, and all who saw these splendid
buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly, What a mighty prince! But
they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor
did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the
destroyed cities.  The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his
magnificent buildings, and thought, like the crowd, What a mighty prince! But I
must have more  much more. No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed
it.  He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them. The conquered
kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through
the streets of his city. These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers feet
when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left. At last the
prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal
palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches - on the altars,
but in this the priests opposed him, saying, Prince, you are mighty indeed, but
Gods power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders.  Well,
said the prince. Then I will conquer God too. And in his haughtiness and
foolish presumption, he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with
which he could sail through the air. It was gorgeously fitted out and of many
colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but
each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and
had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all
directions, while the guns were at once loaded again. Hundreds of eagles were
attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards
the sun. The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and
woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green
meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it. At last
it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds. Higher and higher rose the eagles
up into the air, then God sent one of his numberless angels against the ship.
The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded
from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones. One drop of
blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angels wings and
fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burned into it, and weighed upon it
like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again.
The strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared around the princes
head, and the clouds around  were they formed by the smoke rising up from the
burned cities? Took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which
stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from
which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.  The prince
was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last with a terrible shock
into the branches of a large tree in the wood.  I will conquer God! Said the
prince. I have sworn it. My will must be done!  And he spent seven years in the
construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast
from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with. He gathered warriors
from all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they
covered the space of several miles. They entered the ships and the prince was
approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats one swarm of little gnats.
They buzzed around the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his
sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them,
that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him. The servants carried out
his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings,
crept into the princes ear and stung him. The place burned like fire, and the
poison entered into his blood. Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his
clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his
ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him: The mad prince, who wished to make
war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.

Title = The Boy who Flew too High
Author = Greek Myth
Quote = Ive told you before about the half man-half half-bull called the
Minotaur. This strange and terrible beast lived in a deep, dark Labyrinth on
the island of Crete. Well, you may remember that the Labyrinth was created by
the cunning and ingenious mind of Daedalus.  Daedalus was a brilliant architect
and inventor  in fact, he was so brilliant that King Minos of Crete did not
want to let him go back to his home in Athens. Instead, he kept him as a
prisoner. Daedalus lived with his son Icarus in a tower of the palace, and King
Minos made him invent weapons of war that would make his army and navy even
more powerful than they already were.  Although Daedalus and Icarus had every
comfort they could ask for, the father longed to return home to Athens. His son
hardly remembered his home city, but he too wanted to leave because he longed
to run and play in the open, rather than live in a tower all day.  Daedalus
looked out over the waves of the Mediterranean Sea, and he realised that even
if they could manage to slip out of the tower and find a little boat, they
wouldnt be able to sail very far before they were spotted and caught by one of
the ships of King Minos navy.  He thought for a long time about the best way to
escape, and finally he came up with a plan, and this is what he did... He told
King Minos that he needed feathers and wax for a new invention that he was
working on. When these were brought to him, he took them up onto the roof of
the tower. Here he arranged them into four lines, starting with the smallest
feathers, and followed those with the longer ones so that they formed gentle
curves. He then began to stick the feathers together with thread in the middle
and wax at the base. While he was working, Icarus played with the wax,
squashing it between his finger and thumb, and when the feathers blew away in
the breeze he ran after them and caught them.  When Daedalus had finished, he
showed Icarus his work. He had made the feathers into two pairs of wings. He
fastened the larger pair to his arms, and began to flap them until his feet
took off from the floor and he began to hover in mid air. Icarus laughed with
delight and could not wait to try out the smaller pair of wings. Over the next
few days, father and son both practised with them until little Icarus was
almost as good at flying as his father was.  Then one morning Daedalus said to
Icarus, "Now Son, we are ready to leave this island for good. We shall fly home
to Athens. Although you are now quite good at flying, you must not forget that
it can be very dangerous. Listen to my instructions and be sure to follow them
to the letter. At all times follow me, for I will find the way home. Do not
veer off on a different flight path, or you will soon be lost. Do not fly too
low or your wings will fill with moisture from the waves, and if they will
become too heavy you will sink down. Nor should you fly too high, or the sun
will heat the wax and your wings will fall apart. Have you understood all that
I have said?" Little Icarus nodded to show his father that he had understood.
Then Daedalus led his son up onto the battlements of the tower, and like a bird
leading her fledglings from the nest for the first time, he jumped into mid air
and flapped his wings, Icarus followed soon after.  If a fisherman or a
shepherd had looked up just then, he would have seen two very unusual birds
hovering above the waves. No doubt he would have thought that they had caught
sight of two winged gods. Who could have believed that a mortal father and son
had mastered the art of flight?  Over the seas they sailed, and at first Icarus
felt frightened for he had never ventured very far in his practice flights, but
soon he found that he was really good at flying. In fact, it was the most
tremendous fun you could ever have. He began to swoop up and down with the sea
gulls. Wow! It was amazing! His father turned round and called, "Icarus, take
care!" and for a while after that Icarus obeyed his father, and flapped along
behind him. But then his wings caught a warm air current, and he found that he
could soar along and upwards almost without any effort. This was the life! He
was floating ever so high above the waves and the ships down below were like
tiny little specks.  His father called up to him, Icarus, remember what I told
you. Come down right now! Icarus could not hear him however, and his father
could not catch up with him.  Icarus was far too close to the sun, and soon the
wax that held the feathers together began to melt. Gradually his wings began to
lose their shape, and some of the feathers even began to fall off. Icarus
flapped his arms frantically, but it was too late. He had lost the power of
flight and down he plunged into the sea.

Title = The Tinderbox
Author = Hans Christian Andersen
Quote = A soldier came marching along the high road--left, right! A left,
right! He had his knapsack on his back and a sword by his side, for he had been
to the wars and was now returning home.  An old Witch met him on the road. She
was very ugly to look at: her bottom-lip hung down to her breast.  'Good
evening, Soldier!' she said. 'What a fine sword and knapsack you have! You are
the very picture of a fine soldier! You ought to have as much money as you can
carry!' 'Thank you, old Witch,' said the Soldier.  'Do you see that great tree
there?' said the Witch, pointing to a tree beside them. 'It is hollow within.
You must climb up to the top, and then you will see a hole through which you
can let yourself down into the tree. I will tie a rope round your waist, so
that I may be able to pull you up again when you call.' 'What shall I do down
there?' asked the Soldier.  'Get money!' answered the Witch. 'Listen! When you
reach the bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall; it is
light there, for there are more than three hundred lamps burning. Then you will
see three doors, which you can open--the keys are in the locks. If you go into
the first room, you will see a great chest in the middle of the floor with a
dog sitting upon it; he has eyes as large as saucers, but you needn't trouble
about him. I will give you my blue-check apron, which you must spread out on
the floor, and then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it; open
the chest and take as much money as you like. It is copper there. If you would
rather have silver, you must go into the next room, where there is a dog with
eyes as large as mill-wheels. But don't take any notice of him; just set him
upon my apron, and help yourself to the money. If you prefer gold, you can get
that too, if you go into the third room, and as much as you like to carry. But
the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the Round Tower at
Copenhagen! He is a savage dog, I can tell you; but you needn't be afraid of
him either. Only, put him on my apron and he won't touch you, and you can take
out of the chest as much gold as you like!' 'Come, this is not bad!' said the
Soldier. 'But what am I to give you, old Witch; for surely you are not going to
do this for nothing?' 'Yes, I am!' replied the Witch. 'Not a single farthing
will I take! For me you shall bring nothing but an old tinder-box which my
grandmother forgot last time she was down there.' 'Well, tie the rope round my
waist! 'said the Soldier.  'Here it is,' said the Witch, 'and here is my
blue-check apron.' Then the Soldier climbed up the tree, let himself down
through the hole, and found himself standing, as the Witch had said,
underground in the large hall, where the three hundred lamps were burning.
Well, he opened the first door. Ugh! there sat the dog with eyes as big as
saucers glaring at him.  'You are a fine fellow!' said the Soldier, and put him
on the Witch's apron, took as much copper as his pockets could hold; then he
shut the chest, put the dog on it again, and went into the second room. Sure
enough there sat the dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels.  'You had better
not look at me so hard!' said the Soldier. 'Your eyes will come out of their
sockets!' And then he set the dog on the apron. When he saw all the silver in
the chest, he threw away the copper he had taken, and filled his pockets and
knapsack with nothing but silver.  Then he went into the third room. Horrors!
the dog there had two eyes, each as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen,
spinning round in his head like wheels.  'Good evening!' said the Soldier and
saluted, for he had never seen a dog like this before. But when he had examined
him more closely, he thought to himself: 'Now then, I've had enough of this!'
and put him down on the floor, and opened the chest. Heavens! what a heap of
gold there was! With all that he could buy up the whole town, and all the sugar
pigs, all the tin soldiers, whips and rocking-horses in the whole world. Now he
threw away all the silver with which he had filled his pockets and knapsack,
and filled them with gold instead--yes, all his pockets, his knapsack, cap and
boots even, so that he could hardly walk. Now he was rich indeed. He put the
dog back upon the chest, shut the door, and then called up through the tree:
'Now pull me up again, old Witch!' 'Have you got the tinder-box also?' asked
the Witch.  'Botheration!' said the Soldier, 'I had clean forgotten it!' And
then he went back and fetched it.  The Witch pulled him up, and there he stood
again on the high road, with pockets, knapsack, cap and boots filled with gold.
'What do you want to do with the tinder-box?' asked the Soldier.  'That doesn't
matter to you,' replied the Witch. 'You have got your money, give me my
tinder-box.' 'We'll see!' said the Soldier. 'Tell me at once what you want to
do with it, or I will draw my sword, and cut off your head!' 'No!' screamed the
Witch.  The Soldier immediately cut off her head. That was the end of her! But
he tied up all his gold in her apron, slung it like a bundle over his shoulder,
put the tinder-box in his pocket, and set out towards the town.  It was a
splendid town! He turned into the finest inn, ordered the best chamber and his
favourite dinner; for now that he had so much money he was really rich.  It
certainly occurred to the servant who had to clean his boots that they were
astonishingly old boots for such a rich lord. But that was because he had not
yet bought new ones; next day he appeared in respectable boots and fine
clothes. Now, instead of a common soldier he had become a noble lord, and the
people told him about all the grand doings of the town and the King, and what a
beautiful Princess his daughter was.  'How can one get to see her?' asked the
Soldier.  'She is never to be seen at all!' they told him; 'she lives in a
great copper castle, surrounded by many walls and towers! No one except the
King may go in or out, for it is prophesied that she will marry a common
soldier, and the King cannot submit to that.' 'I should very much like to see
her,' thought the Soldier; but he could not get permission.  Now he lived very
gaily, went to the theatre, drove in the King's garden, and gave the poor a
great deal of money, which was very nice of him; he had experienced in former
times how hard it is not to have a farthing in the world. Now he was rich, wore
fine clothes, and made many friends, who all said that he was an excellent man,
a real nobleman. And the Soldier liked that. But as he was always spending
money, and never made any more, at last the day came when he had nothing left
but two shillings, and he had to leave the beautiful rooms in which he had been
living, and go into a little attic under the roof, and clean his own boots, and
mend them with a darning-needle. None of his friends came to visit him there,
for there were too many stairs to climb.  It was a dark evening, and he could
not even buy a light. But all at once it flashed across him that there was a
little end of tinder in the tinder-box, which he had taken from the hollow tree
into which the Witch had helped him down. He found the box with the tinder in
it; but just as he was kindling a light, and had struck a spark out of the
tinder-box, the door burst open, and the dog with eyes as large as saucers,
which he had seen down in the tree, stood before him and said: 'What does my
lord command?' 'What's the meaning of this?' exclaimed the Soldier. 'This is a
pretty kind of tinder-box, if I can get whatever I want like this. Get me
money!' he cried to the dog, and hey, presto! he was off and back again,
holding a great purse full of money in his mouth.  Now the Soldier knew what a
wonderful tinder-box this was. If he rubbed once, the dog that sat on the chest
of copper appeared; if he rubbed twice, there came the dog that watched over
the silver chest; and if he rubbed three times, the one that guarded the gold
appeared. Now, the Soldier went down again to his beautiful rooms, and appeared
once more in splendid clothes. All his friends immediately recognised him
again, and paid him great court.  One day he thought to himself: 'It is very
strange that no one can get to see the Princess. They all say she is very
pretty, but what's the use of that if she has to sit for ever in the great
copper castle with all the towers? Can I not manage to see her somehow? Where
is my tinder-box?' and so he struck a spark, and, presto! there came the dog
with eyes as large as saucers.  'It is the middle of the night, I know,' said
the Soldier; 'but I should very much like to see the Princess for a moment.'
The dog was already outside the door, and before the Soldier could look round,
in he came with the Princess. She was lying asleep on the dog's back, and was
so beautiful that anyone could see she was a real Princess. The Soldier really
could not refrain from kissing her--he was such a thorough Soldier. Then the
dog ran back with the Princess. But when it was morning, and the King and Queen
were drinking tea, the Princess said that the night before she had had such a
strange dream about a dog and a Soldier: she had ridden on the dog's back, and
the Soldier had kissed her.  'That is certainly a fine story,' said the Queen.
But the next night one of the ladies-in-waiting was to watch at the Princess's
bed, to see if it was only a dream, or if it had actually happened.  The
Soldier had an overpowering longing to see the Princess again, and so the dog
came in the middle of the night and fetched her, running as fast as he could.
But the lady-in-waiting slipped on soft rubber shoes and followed them. When
she saw them disappear into a large house, she thought to herself: 'Now I know
where it is; 'and made a great cross on the door with a piece of chalk. Then
she went home and lay down, and the dog came back also, with the Princess. But
when he saw that a cross had been made on the door of the house where the
Soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk also, and made crosses on all the doors
in the town; and that was very clever, for now the lady-in-waiting could not
find the right house, as there were crosses on all the doors.  Early next
morning the King, Queen, ladies-in-waiting, and officers came out to see where
the Princess had been.  'There it is!' said the King, when he saw the first
door with a cross on it.  'No, there it is, my dear!' said the Queen, when she
likewise saw a door with a cross.  'But here is one, and there is another!'
they all exclaimed; wherever they looked there was a cross on the door. Then
they realised that the sign would not help them at all.  But the Queen was an
extremely clever woman, who could do a great deal more than just drive in a
coach. She took her great golden scissors, cut up a piece of silk, and made a
pretty little bag of it. This she filled with the grains of porridge oats, and
tied it round the Princess' neck; this done, she cut a little hole in the bag,
so that the grains would strew the whole road wherever the Princess went.  In
the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back and ran away with
her to the Soldier, who was very much in love with her, and would have liked to
have been a Prince, so that he might have had her for his wife.  The dog did
not notice how the grains were strewn right from the castle to the Soldier's
window, where he ran up the wall with the Princess.  In the morning the King
and the Queen saw plainly where their daughter had been, and they took the
Soldier and put him into prison.  There he sat. Oh, how dark and dull it was
there! And they told him: 'To-morrow you are to be hanged.' Hearing that did
not exactly cheer him, and he had left his tinder-box in the inn.  Next morning
he could see through the iron grating in front of his little window how the
people were hurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the drums and
saw the soldiers marching; all the people were running to and fro. Just below
his window was a shoemaker's apprentice, with leather apron and shoes; he was
skipping along so merrily that one of his shoes flew off and fell against the
wall, just where the Soldier was sitting peeping through the iron grating.
'Oh, shoemaker's boy, you needn't be in such a hurry!' said the Soldier to him.
'There's nothing going on till I arrive. But if you will run back to the house
where I lived, and fetch me my tinder-box, I will give you four shillings. But
you must put your best foot foremost.' The shoemaker's boy was very willing to
earn four shillings, and fetched the tinder-box, gave it to the Soldier,
and--yes--now you shall hear.  Outside the town a great scaffold had been
erected, and all round were standing the soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of
people. The King and Queen were sitting on a magnificent throne opposite the
judges and the whole council.  The Soldier was already standing on the top of
the ladder; but when they wanted to put the rope round his neck, he said that
the fulfilment of one innocent request was always granted to a poor criminal
before he underwent his punishment. He would so much like to smoke a small pipe
of tobacco; it would be his last pipe in this world.  The King could not refuse
him this, and so he took out his tinder-box, and rubbed it once, twice, three
times. And lo, and behold I there stood all three dogs--the one with eyes as
large as saucers, the second with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third
with eyes each as large as the Round Tower of Copenhagen.  'Help me now, so
that I may not be hanged!' cried the Soldier. And thereupon the dogs fell upon
the judges and the whole council, seized some by the legs, others by the nose,
and threw them so high into the air that they fell and were smashed into
pieces.  'I won't stand this!' said the King; but the largest dog seized him
too, and the Queen as well, and threw them up after the others. This frightened
the soldiers, and all the people cried: 'Good Soldier, you shall be our King,
and marry the beautiful Princess!' Then they put the Soldier into the King's
coach, and the three dogs danced in front, crying 'Hurrah!' And the boys
whistled and the soldiers presented arms.  The Princess came out of the copper
castle, and became Queen; and that pleased her very much.  The wedding
festivities lasted for eight days, and the dogs sat at table and made eyes at
everyone.

Title = The Nightingale
Author = Hans Christian Andersen
Quote = The story I am going to tell you happened a great many years ago in
China, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten. The emperors palace
was the most beautiful in the world. It was built entirely of porcelain, and
very costly, but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to
be careful. In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty
silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed could not
help noticing the flowers. Indeed, everything in the emperors garden was
remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where
it ended. Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble
forest, with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great
ships sailed under the shadow of its branches. In one of these trees lived a
nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so
many other things to do, would stop and listen. Sometimes, when they went at
night to spread their nets, they would hear her sing, and say, Oh, is not that
beautiful? But when they returned to their fishing, they forgot the bird until
the next night. Then they would hear it again, and exclaim, Oh, how beautiful
is the nightingales song!  Travellers from every country in the world came to
the city of the emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the palace
and gardens; but when they heard the nightingale, they all declared it to be
the best of all. And the travellers, on their return home, related what they
had seen; and learned men wrote books, containing descriptions of the town, the
palace, and the gardens; but they did not forget the nightingale, which was
really the greatest wonder. And those who could write poetry composed beautiful
verses about the nightingale, who lived in a forest near the deep sea. The
books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the
emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and as he read, he nodded his approval
every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his
city, his palace, and his gardens. But when he came to the words, the
nightingale is the most beautiful of all, he exclaimed, What is this? I know
nothing of any nightingale. Is there such a bird in my empire? Even in my
garden? I have never heard of it. Something, it appears, may be learnt from
books.  Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that
when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question,
he would answer, Pooh, which means nothing.  There is a very wonderful bird
mentioned here, called a nightingale, said the emperor, they say it is the best
thing in my large kingdom. Why have I not been told of it?  I have never heard
the name, replied the cavalier, she has not been presented at court.  It is my
pleasure that she shall appear this evening, said the emperor. The whole world
knows what I possess better than I do myself.  I have never heard of her, said
the cavalier, yet I will endeavour to find her.  But where was the nightingale
to be found? The nobleman went upstairs and down, through halls and passages;
yet none of those whom he met had heard of the bird. So he returned to the
emperor, and said that it must be a fable, invented by those who had written
the book. Your Imperial Majesty, said he, cannot believe everything contained
in books; sometimes they are only fiction, or what is called the black art.
But the book in which I have read this account, said the emperor, was sent to
me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a
falsehood. I will hear the nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has
my highest favour and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled
upon after supper is ended.  Tsing-pe! Cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he
ran up and downstairs, through all the halls and corridors; and half the court
ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon. There was
a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom all the world knew, but
who was unknown to the court.  At last they met with a poor little girl in the
kitchen, who said, Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well; indeed, she can
sing. Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the
scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I
feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingales
song. Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed
me.  Little maiden, said the lord-in-waiting, I will obtain for you constant
employment in the kitchen, and you shall have permission to see the emperor
dine, if you will lead us to the nightingale; for she is invited for this
evening to the palace. So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang,
and half the court followed her. As they went along, a cow began lowing.  Oh,
said a young courtier, now we have found her! What wonderful power for such a
small creature; I have certainly heard it before.  No, that is only a cow
lowing, said the little girl, we are a long way from the place yet.  Then some
frogs began to croak in the marsh.  Beautiful, said the young courtier again.
Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells.  No, those are frogs, said
the little maiden, but I think we shall soon hear her now, and presently the
nightingale began to sing.  Hark, hark! There she is, said the girl, and there
she sits, she added, pointing to a little grey bird who was perched on a bough.
Is it possible? Said the lord-in-waiting. I never imagined it would be a
little, plain, simple thing like that. She has certainly changed colour at
seeing so many grand people around her.  Little nightingale, cried the girl,
raising her voice, our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him.
With the greatest pleasure, said the nightingale, and began to sing most
delightfully.  It sounds like tiny glass bells, said the lord-in-waiting, and
see how her little throat works. It is surprising that we have never heard this
before; she will be a great success at court.  Shall I sing once more before
the emperor? Asked the nightingale, who thought he was present.  My excellent
little nightingale, said the courtier, I have the great pleasure of inviting
you to a court festival this evening, where you will gain imperial favour by
your charming song.  My song sounds best in the green wood, said the bird; but
still she came willingly when she heard the emperors wish.  The palace was
elegantly decorated for the occasion. The walls and floors of porcelain
glittered in the light of a thousand lamps. Beautiful flowers, around which
little bells were tied, stood in the corridors - what with the running to and
fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to
be heard. In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for
the nightingale to sit on. The whole court was present, and the little
kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door. She was not
installed as a real court cook. All were in full dress, and every eye was
turned to the little grey bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin. The
nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperors eyes, and
then rolled down his cheeks as her song became still more touching and went to
every ones heart. The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale
should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the
honour with thanks as she had been sufficiently rewarded already. I have seen
tears in an emperors eyes, she said, that is my richest reward. An emperors
tears have wonderful power, and are quite sufficient honour for me, and then
she sang again more enchantingly than ever.  That singing is a lovely gift,
said the ladies of the court to each other, and then they took water in their
mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they
spoke to anyone, so that they might fancy themselves nightingales. The footmen
and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great
deal, for they are very difficult to please. In fact the nightingales visit was
most successful. She was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with
liberty to go out twice a day, and once during the night. Twelve servants were
appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken
string fastened to her leg. There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind
of flying.  The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people
met, one said nightin, and the other said gale, and they understood what was
meant, for nothing else was talked of. Eleven peddlers children were named
after her, but not of them could sing a note.  One day the emperor received a
large packet on which was written, The Nightingale. Here is no doubt a new book
about our celebrated bird, said the emperor. But instead of a book, it was a
work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like
a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. As
soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and
could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold. Around
its neck hung a piece of ribbon, on which was written The Emperor of Chinas
nightingale is poor compared with that of the Emperor of Japans.  This is very
beautiful, exclaimed all who saw it, and he who had brought the artificial bird
received the title of Imperial nightingale-bringer-in-chief.  Now they must
sing together, said the court, and what a duet it will be. But they did not get
on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the
artificial bird sang only waltzes.  That is not a fault, said the music master,
it is quite perfect to my taste, so then it had to sing alone, and was as
successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for
it sparkled like bracelets and breast pins. Three and thirty times did it sing
the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it
again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something. But
where was she? No one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window,
back to her own green woods.  What strange conduct, said the emperor, when her
flight had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was
a very ungrateful creature.  But we have the best bird after all, said one, and
then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth
time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it,
for it was rather difficult. But the music-master praised the bird in the
highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale;
not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical
power. For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real
nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird
everything is settled. It can be opened and explained, so that people may
understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another.
This is exactly what we think, they all replied, and then the music-master
received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday,
and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing. When
they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with
drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom. They all said, Oh! and held up
their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real
nightingale, said, It sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike;
yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what.  After this the
real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed
on a silk cushion close to the emperors bed. The presents of gold and precious
stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now
advanced to the title of Little Imperial Toilet Singer, and to the rank of No.
1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the
heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place
as that of other people.  The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five
volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and
full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had read
it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies
trampled upon.  So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other
Chinese persons knew every little turn in the artificial birds song; and for
that same reason it pleased them better. They could sing with the bird, which
they often did. The street-boys sang, Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck, and the
emperor himself could sing it also. It was really most amusing.  One evening,
when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the emperor lay in bed
listening to it, something inside the bird sounded whizz. Then a spring
cracked. Whir-r-r-r went all the wheels, running round, and then the music
stopped. The emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his
physician; but what could he do? Then they sent for a watchmaker; and after a
great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like
order, but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were
worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music.
Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a
year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it. Then the
music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the
bird was as good as ever - and of course no one contradicted him.  Five years
passed, and then a real grief came upon the land. The Chinese really were fond
of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live.
Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street
asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was, but he only said, Pooh! and
shook his head.  Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed. The whole
court thought he was dead, and everyone ran away to pay homage to his
successor. The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and the
ladies maids invited company to take coffee. Cloth had been laid down on the
halls and passages, so that not a footstep should be heard, and all was silent
and still. But the emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on
his gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels. A
window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial
bird. The poor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange weight
on his chest, opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there. He had put on the
emperors golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the
other his beautiful banner. All around the bed and peeping through the long
velvet curtains were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others
lovely and gentle-looking. These were the emperors good and bad deeds, which
stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.  Do you remember this? Do
you recollect that? They asked one after another, thus bringing to his
remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow.  I know
nothing about it, said the emperor. Music! Music! He cried. The large Chinese
drum! That I may not hear what they say. But they still went on, and Death
nodded like a China-man to all they said. Music! Music! Shouted the emperor.
You little precious golden bird, sing, pray sing! I have given you gold and
costly presents; I have even hung my golden slipper around your neck. Sing!
Sing! But the bird remained silent. There was no one to wind it up, and
therefore it could not sing a note.  Death continued to stare at the emperor
with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still. Suddenly there
came through the open window the sound of sweet music. Outside, on the bough of
a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the emperors illness, and
was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust. As she sung, the shadows
grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperors veins flowed more rapidly, and
gave life to his weak limbs. Even Death himself listened, and said, Go on,
little nightingale, go on.  Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword
and that rich banner? Will you give me the emperors crown? Said the bird.  So
Death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and the nightingale continued
her singing. She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow,
where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet
grass is moistened by the mourners tears. Then Death longed to go and see his
garden, and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.
Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird. I know you well. I banished you from
my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and
banished Death from my heart with your sweet song. How can I reward you?  You
have already rewarded me, said the nightingale. I shall never forget that I
drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang to you. These are the jewels
that rejoice a singers heart. But now sleep, and grow strong and well again. I
will sing to you again.  As she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and
how mild and refreshing that slumber was! When he awoke, strengthened and
restored, the sun shone brightly through the window, but not one of his
servants had returned  they all believed he was dead; only the nightingale
still sat beside him, and sang.  You must always remain with me, said the
emperor. You shall sing only when it pleases you, and I will break the
artificial bird into a thousand pieces.  No! Do not do that, replied the
nightingale, the bird did very well as long as it could. Keep it here still. I
cannot live in the palace and build my nest; but let me come when I like. I
will sit on a bough outside your window in the evening and sing to you, so that
you may be happy and have thoughts full of joy. I will sing to you of those who
are happy, and those who suffer; of the good and the evil who are hidden around
you. The little singing bird flies far from you and your court to the home of
the fisherman and the peasants cot. I love your heart better than your crown;
and yet something holy lingers around that also. I will come, I will sing to
you; but you must promise me one thing.  Everything, said the emperor, who
having dressed himself in his imperial robes, stood with the hand that held the
heavy golden sword pressed to his heart.  I only ask one thing, she replied,
let no one know that you have a little bird who tells you everything. It will
be best to conceal it. So saying, the nightingale flew away.  The servants now
came in to look after the dead emperor; when lo! There he stood, and to their
astonishment, said, Good morning.

Title = Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves
Author =  1001 Nights
Quote = In a town in Persia there dwelled two brothers, one named Cassim, the
other Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a rich wife and lived in plenty; while
Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and children by cutting wood in a
neighbouring forest and selling it in the town. One day, when Ali Baba was in
the forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback, coming toward him in a cloud of
dust. He was afraid they were robbers, and climbed into a tree for safety. When
they came up to him and dismounted, he counted forty of them. They unbridled
their horses and tied them to trees. The finest man among them, whom Ali Baba
took to be their captain, went a little way among some bushes, and said: Open
Sesame! so plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A door opened in the rocks, and
having made the troop go in, he followed them, and the door shut again of
itself. They stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba, fearing they might come out
and catch him, was forced to sit patiently in the tree. At last the door opened
again, and the forty thieves came out. As the captain went in last, he came out
first, and made them all pass by him. He then closed the door, saying, Shut
Sesame! Every man bridled his horse and mounted. The captain put himself at
their head, and they returned as they came.  Then Ali Baba climbed down and
went to the door concealed among the bushes, and said: Open Sesame! It flew
open. Ali Baba, who expected a dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised to
find it large and well lighted, hollowed by the hand of man in the form of a
vault, which received the light from an opening in the ceiling. He saw rich
bales of merchandise  silk brocades, all piled together, and gold and silver in
heaps, and money in leather purses. He went in and the door shut behind him. He
did not look at the silver, but brought out as many bags of gold as he thought
his asses, which were browsing outside, could carry. He loaded them with the
bags, and hid it all with fagots. Using the words: Shut Sesame! he closed the
door and went home.  Then he drove his asses into the yard, shut the gates,
carried the money-bags to his wife, and emptied them out before her. He bade
her to keep the secret, and he would go and bury the gold. Let me first measure
it, said his wife. I will go and borrow a measure off someone, while you dig
the hole. So she ran to the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure. Knowing Ali
Babas poverty, the sister was curious to find out what sort of grain his wife
wished to measure, and artfully put some suet at the bottom of the measure. Ali
Babas wife went home and set the measure on the heap of gold, and filled it and
emptied it often, to her great content. She then carried it back to her sister,
without noticing that a piece of gold was sticking to it, which Cassims wife
perceived directly whilst her back was turned. She grew very curious, and said
to Cassim when he came home: Cassim, your brother is richer than you. He does
not count his money, he measures it. He begged her to explain this riddle,
which she did by showing him the piece of money and telling him where she found
it. Then Cassim grew so envious that he could not sleep, and went to his
brother in the morning before sunrise. Ali Baba, he said, showing him the gold
piece, you pretend to be poor and yet you measure gold. By this Ali Baba
perceived that through his wifes folly Cassim and his wife knew their secret,
so he confessed all and offered Cassim a share. That I expect, said Cassim, but
I must know where to find the treasure, otherwise I will discover all, and you
will lose all. Ali Baba, more out of kindness than fear, told him of the cave,
and the very words to use. Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand with
him and get the treasure for himself. He rose early next morning, and set out
with ten mules loaded with great chests. He soon found the place, and the door
in the rock. He said: Open Sesame! and the door opened and shut behind him. He
could have feasted his eyes all day on the treasures, but he now hastened to
gather together as much of it as possible; but when he was ready to go he could
not remember what to say for thinking of his great riches. Instead of Sesame,
he said: Open Barley! and the door remained fast. He named several different
sorts of grain, all but the right one, and the door still stuck fast. He was so
frightened at the danger he was in that he had as much forgotten the word as if
he had never heard it.  About noon the robbers returned to their cave, and saw
Cassims mules roving about with great chests on their backs. This gave them the
alarm; they drew their sabres, and went to the door, which opened on their
Captains saying: Open Sesame! Cassim, who had heard the trampling of their
horses feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so when the door opened he
leaped out and threw the Captain down. In vain, however, for the robbers with
their sabres soon killed him. On entering the cave they saw all the bags laid
ready, and could not imagine how anyone had got in without knowing their
secret. They cut Cassims body into four quarters, and nailed them up inside the
cave, in order to frighten anyone who should venture in, and went away in
search of more treasure.  As night drew on Cassims wife grew very uneasy, and
ran to her brother-in-law, and told him where her husband had gone. Ali Baba
did his best to comfort her, and set out to the forest in search of Cassim. The
first thing he saw on entering the cave was his dead brother. Full of horror,
he put the body on one of his asses, and bags of gold on the other two, and,
covering all with some fagots, returned home. He drove the two asses laden with
gold into his own yard, and led the other to Cassims house. The door was opened
by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew to be both brave and cunning. Unloading the
ass, he said to her: This is the body of your master, who has been murdered,
but whom we must bury as though he had died in his bed. I will speak with you
again, but now tell your mistress I am come. The wife of Cassim, on learning
the fate of her husband, broke out into cries and tears, but Ali Baba offered
to take her to live with him and his wife if she would promise to keep his
counsel and leave everything to Morgiana; whereupon she agreed, and dried her
eyes.  Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an apothecary and asked him for some
lozenges. My poor master, she said, can neither eat nor speak, and no one knows
what his distemper is. She carried home the lozenges and returned next day
weeping, and asked for an essence only given to those just about to die. Thus,
in the evening, no one was surprised to hear the wretched shrieks and cries of
Cassims wife and Morgiana, telling everyone that Cassim was dead. The day
after, Morgiana went to an old cobbler near the gates of the town who opened
his stall early, put a piece of gold in his hand, and bade him to follow her
with his needle and thread. Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief, she took
him to the room where the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and bade him to sew
the quarters together, after which she covered his eyes again and led him home.
Then they buried Cassim, and Morgiana his slave followed him to the grave,
weeping and tearing her hair, while Cassims wife stayed at home uttering
lamentable cries. Next day she went to live with Ali Baba, who gave Cassims
shop to his eldest son.  The Forty Thieves, on their return to the cave, were
much astonished to find Cassims body gone and some of their money-bags. We are
certainly discovered, said the Captain, and shall be undone if we cannot find
out who it is that knows our secret. Two men must have known it; we have killed
one, we must now find the other. To this end one of you who is bold and artful
must go into the city dressed as a traveller, and discover whom we have killed,
and whether men talk of the strange manner of his death. If the messenger fails
he must lose his life, lest we be betrayed. One of the thieves started up and
offered to do this, and after the rest had highly commended him for his bravery
he disguised himself, and happened to enter the town at daybreak, just by Baba
Mustaphas stall. The thief bade him good-day, saying: Honest man, how can you
possibly see to stitch at your age? Old as I am, replied the cobbler, I have
very good eyes, and will you believe me when I tell you that I sewed a dead
body together in a place where I had less light than I have now. The robber was
overjoyed at his good fortune, and, giving him a piece of gold, desired to be
shown the house where he stitched up the dead body. At first Mustapha refused,
saying that he had been blindfolded; but when the robber gave him another piece
of gold he began to think he might remember the turnings if blindfolded as
before. This means he succeeded; the robber partly led him, and was partly
guided by him, right in front of Cassims house, the door of which the robber
marked with a piece of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade farewell to Baba
Mustapha and returned to the forest. By and by Morgiana, going out, saw the
mark the robber had made, quickly guessed that some mischief was brewing, and
fetching a piece of chalk marked two or three doors on each side, without
saying anything to her master or mistress.  The thief,  in the meantime, told
his comrades of his discovery. The Captain thanked him, and bade him to show
him the house he had marked. But when they came to it they saw that five or six
of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that
he knew not what answer to make, and when they returned he was at once beheaded
for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba
Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever
for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved
to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but
looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and
ordered his men to go into the neighbouring villages and buy nineteen mules,
and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The
Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the
jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with
thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk.
The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Babas house, and said to Ali
Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: I have brought some oil from a
distance to sell at tomorrows market, but it is now so late that I know not
where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favour to take me in. Though
Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not
recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him welcome, opened
his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her to prepare a
bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after
they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the
Captain went into the yard under pretence of seeing after his mules, but really
to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last,
he said to each man: As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the
chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I
will be with you in a trice. He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to
his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to
make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went
out, and she had no more oil in the house. Do not be uneasy, said Abdallah: go
into the yard and take some out of one of those jars. Morgiana thanked him for
his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the
first jar the robber inside said softly: Is it time?  Any other slave but
Morgiana, on finding a man in the jar instead of the oil she wanted, would have
screamed and made a noise; but she, knowing the danger her master was in,
bethought herself of a plan, and answered quietly: Not yet, but presently. She
went to all the jars, giving the same answer, till she came to the jar of oil.
She now saw that her master, thinking to entertain an oil merchant, had let
thirty-eight robbers into his house. She filled her oil pot, went back to the
kitchen, and, having lit her lamp, went again to the oil jar and filled a large
kettle full of oil. When it boiled she went and poured enough oil into every
jar to stifle and kill the robber inside. When this brave deed was done she
went back to the kitchen, put out the fire and the lamp, and waited to see what
would happen.  In a quarter of an hour the Captain of the robbers awoke, got
up, and opened the window. As all seemed quiet, he threw down some little
pebbles which hit the jars. He listened, and as none of his men seemed to stir
he grew uneasy, and went down into the yard. On going to the first jar and
saying: Are you asleep? he smelt the hot boiled oil, and knew at once that his
plot to murder Ali Baba and his household had been discovered. He found all the
gang was dead, and, missing the oil out of the last jar, became aware of the
manner of their death. He then forced the lock of a door leading into a garden,
and climbing over several walls made his escape. Morgiana heard and saw all
this, and, rejoicing at her success, went to bed and fell asleep.  At daybreak
Ali Baba arose, and, seeing the oil jars still there, asked why the merchant
had not gone with his mules. Morgiana bade him look in the first jar and see if
there was any oil. Seeing a man, he started back in terror. Have no fear, said
Morgiana; the man cannot harm you: he is dead. Ali Baba, when he had recovered
somewhat from his astonishment, asked what had become of the merchant.
Merchant! said she, he is no more a merchant than I am! and she told him the
whole story, assuring him that it was a plot of the robbers of the forest, of
whom only three were left, and that the white and red chalk marks had something
to do with it. Ali Baba at once gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that he owed
her his life. They then buried the bodies in Ali Babas garden, while the mules
were sold in the market by his slaves.  The Captain returned to his lonely
cave, which seemed frightful to him without his lost companions, and firmly
resolved to avenge them by killing Ali Baba. He dressed himself carefully, and
went into the town, where he took lodgings in an inn. In the course of a great
many journeys to the forest he carried away many rich stuffs and much fine
linen, and set up a shop opposite that of Ali Babas son. He called himself
Cogia Hassan, and as he was both civil and well dressed he soon made friends
with Ali Babas son, and through him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually
asking to sup with him. Ali Baba, wishing to return his kindness, invited him
into his house and received him smiling, thanking him for his kindness to his
son. When the merchant was about to take his leave, Ali Baba stopped him,
saying: Where are you going, sir, in such haste? Will you not stay and sup with
me? The merchant refused, saying that he had a reason; and on Ali Babas asking
him what that was, he replied: It is sir, that I can eat no victuals that have
any salt in them. If that is all, said Ali Baba, let me tell you that there
shall be no salt in either the meat or the bread that we eat tonight. He went
to give this order to Morgiana, who was much surprised. Who is this man? she
said, who eats no salt with his meat? He is an honest man, Morgiana, returned
her master, therefore do as I bid you. But she could not withstand a desire to
see this strange man, so she helped Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and saw in
a moment that Cogia Hassan was the robber Captain, and carried a dagger under
his garment. I am not surprised, she said to herself, that this wicked man, who
intends to kill my master, will eat no salt with him, but I will hinder his
plans.  She sent up the supper by Abdallah, while she made ready for one of the
boldest acts that could be thought on. When the dessert had been served, Cogia
Hassan was left alone with Ali Baba and his son, whom he thought to make drunk
and then to murder them. Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress like a
dancing-girls, and clasped a girdle round her waist, from which hung a dagger
with a silver hilt, and said to Abdallah: Take your tabor, and let us go and
divert our master and his guest. Abdallah took his tabor and played before
Morgiana until they came to the door, where Abdallah stopped playing and
Morgiana made a low courtesy. Come in, Morgiana, said Ali Baba, and let Cogia
Hassan see what you can do, and turning to Cogia Hassan, he said: Shes my slave
and my housekeeper. Cogia Hassan was by no means pleased, for he feared that
his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone for the present, but he pretended great
eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah began to play and Morgiana to dance.
After she had performed several dances she drew her dagger and made passes with
it, sometimes pointing it at her own breast, sometimes at her masters, as if it
were part of the dance. Suddenly, out of breath, she snatched the tabor from
Abdallah with her left hand, and, holding the dagger in her right hand, held
out the tabor to her master. Ali Baba and his son put a piece of gold into it,
and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was coming to him, pulled out his purse to
make her a present, but while he was putting his hand into it Morgiana plunged
the dagger into his heart.  Unhappy girl! cried Ali Baba and his son, what have
you done to ruin us?  It was to preserve you, master, not to ruin you, answered
Morgiana. See here, opening the false merchants garment and showing the dagger.
See what an enemy you have entertained! Remember, he would eat no salt with
you, and what more would you have? Look at him! He is both the false oil
merchant and the Captain of the Forty Thieves.  Ali Baba was so grateful to
Morgiana for thus saving his life that he offered her to his son in marriage,
who readily consented, and a few days after, the wedding was celebrated with
greatest splendor.  At the end of a year Ali Baba, hearing nothing of the two
remaining robbers, judged they were dead, and set out to the cave. The door
opened on his saying: Open Sesame! He went in, and saw that nobody had been
there since the Captain left it. He brought away as much gold as he could
carry, and returned to town. He told his son the secret of the cave, which his
son handed down in his turn, so the children and grandchildren of Ali Baba were
rich to the end of their lives.

Title = The Billy Goats Gruff
Author = Bill Goat
Quote = Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to the
hillside to eat grass and make themselves fat. The name of each one of them was
Gruff.  On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to cross;
and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll, with eyes as big as saucers, and
a nose as long as a poker.  So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff
to cross the bridge.  Trip, trap! Trip, trap! Trip trap! went the bridge as he
trotted across.  Whos that tripping over my bridge? roared the troll.  Oh, it
is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff, and Im going up to the hillside to
make myself fat, said the billy goat, with such a small voice.  Now, Im coming
to gobble you up, said the troll.  Oh, no! pray dont take me. Im too little,
that I am, said the billy goat. Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff
comes. Hes much bigger.  Well, be off with you, said the troll.  A little while
after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.  Trip trap! Trip
trap! Trip trap! went the bridge.  Whos that tripping over my bridge? roared
the troll.  Oh, its the second Billy Goat Gruff, and Im going up to the
hillside to make myself fat, said the billy goat, who hadnt such a small voice.
Now Im coming to gobble you up, said the troll.  Oh, no! Dont take me. Wait a
little till the big Billy Goat Gruff comes. Hes much bigger.  Very well! Be off
with you, said the troll.  But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff.
Trip trap! Trip trap! Trip trap! went the bridge, for the billy goat was so
heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him.  Whos that tramping over
my bridge? roared the troll.  Its I!The big Billy Goat Gruff, said the billy
goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.  Now Im coming to gobble you up,
roared the troll.  Well, come along! Ive got two spears, and Ill poke your
eyeballs out at your ears.  Ive got besides two curling-stones, and Ill crush
you to bits, body and bones.  That was what the big billy goat said. And then
he flew at the troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to
bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the ravine and after that he went
up to the hillside. There the billy goats got so fat they were scarcely able to
walk home again. And if the fat hasnt fallen off them, why, theyre still fat;
and so, Snip Snap Snout..

Title = Goldilocks and the Three Bears 
Author = Goldilocks
Quote = Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house
of their own in a wood. One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a
middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear.  One day, after they
had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the
porridge was cooling. And while they were walking, a little girl came into the
house. This little girl had golden curls that tumbled down her back to her
waist, and everyone called her by Goldilocks.  Goldilocks went inside. First
she tasted the porridge of the great, huge bear, and that was far too hot for
her. And then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear, and that was too cold
for her. And then she went to the porridge of the little, small wee bear, and
tasted that. And that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she
liked it so well, that she ate it all up.  Then Goldilocks went upstairs into
the bed chamber and first she lay down upon the bed of the great, huge bear,
and then she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and finally she lay down
upon the bed of the little, small wee bear, and that was just right. So she
covered herself up comfortably, and lay there until she fell fast asleep.  By
this time, the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough, so they
came home to breakfast.  SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE! said the great huge
bear, in his great huge voice.  Somebody has been at my porridge! said the
middle bear, in his middle voice.  Then the little, small wee bear looked at
his, and there was the spoon in the porridge pot, but the porridge was all
gone.  Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up! said the
little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.  Then the three bears
went upstairs into their bedroom.  SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED! said the
great, huge bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.  Somebody has been lying in
my bed! said the middle bear, in his middle voice.  And when the little, small,
wee bear came to look at his bed, upon the pillow there was a pool of golden
curls, and the angelic face of a little girl snoring away, fast asleep.
Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is! Said the little, small wee
bear, in his little, small wee voice.  Goldilocks jumped off the bed and ran
downstairs, out of the door and down the garden path. She ran and she ran until
she reached the house of her grandmama. When she told her grandmama about the
house of the three bears who lived in the wood, her granny said: My my, what a
wild imagination you have, child!

Title = The Sleeping Beauty 
Author = Sleeping
Quote = Once upon a time, there lived a king and a queen, who had no children. They
were so sorry about having no children, that I cannot tell you how sorry they
were. At last, however, after many years, the queen had a daughter.  There was
a very fine christening for the baby princess. The king and queen looked
throughout the kingdom for fairies to be her godmothers, and they found seven
fairies. Each fairy godmother was to give the princess a gift, as was the
custom of fairies in those days. In this way, the princess had all the
perfections imaginable.  After the christening ceremony was over, the whole
party returned to the kings palace, where there was prepared a great feast for
the seven fairy godmothers. There was placed before each one of them a
magnificent case of gold, in which were a spoon, knife, and fork; all of pure
gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as everyone was sitting down at the
table, they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not invited,
because she had not left the tower where she lived for over fifty years, and
she was believed to be either dead or under an evil spell.  The king could not
give her a case of gold as the others had been given, because they had only
seven made for the seven fairies. The old fairy felt insulted and muttered some
threats between her teeth. One of the young fairies who sat by her overheard
how she grumbled; and guessing that she might give the little princess an
unlucky gift, went, as soon as they rose from table, and hid behind the
curtains, so that she might make the last wish for the little princess, and use
it to put right any evil that the old fairy might do with her magic spell.
Meanwhile, all the fairies began to give their gifts to the princess. The
youngest wished that she should be the most beautiful person in the world. The
next, that she should have the intelligence of an angel. The third, that she
should have a wonderful grace in everything she did. The fourth, that she
should dance perfectly well. The fifth, that she should sing like a
nightingale, and the sixth, that she should play all kinds of music to the
utmost perfection.  The old fairys turn came next, and shaking her head more
with spite than anger, said that one day the princess would have her hand
pricked by a needle on a spinning wheel and that she would die of the wound.
This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and everybody began to cry.
At this very instant the young fairy came out from behind the curtains, and
spoke these words aloud: Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your
daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo
entirely what the elder fairy has done. The princess shall indeed pierce her
hand with a needle on a spinning wheel, but instead of dying, she shall only
fall into a deep sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the end of which a
kings son shall come and awake her.  The king, to avoid the misfortune foretold
by the old fairy, immediately made a law by which everybody was forbidden, on
pain of death, to use a spinning wheel, or to have any spinning wheel in their
houses.  About fifteen or sixteen years later, on a day when the king and queen
were busy in a far corner of the vast palace, the young and beautiful princess
amused herself by running up and down the corridors and going up from one
apartment to another. Eventually, she came into a little room at the top of the
tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her wheel, for this
good old woman had never heard of the kings law against spinning wheels.  The
princess said: What are you doing there, good old woman?  I am spinning sheeps
wool into thread so that I can knit it into a cardigan.  Ha! Said the princess,
thats very clever. Ive never seen that done before. How do you do it? Give it
to me, so that I may see if I can do the same.  Now whether it was because she
was in too much of a hurry, or whether it was because she was clumsy, or
whether it was because the old fairy had wished it so, I cannot say  but no
sooner than the princess took the spinning wheel, than she pricked her hand on
the needle, and she fell down in a faint.  The good old woman, not knowing what
to do, cried out for help. People came rushing from all over the palace and
they came in great numbers. When they saw the princess lying in a deep, deep
sleep on the floor, they threw cold water on her face, they loosened her
clothes, they struck her on the palms of her hands, and they rubbed her temples
with smelling salts, but nothing they could do would awaken the princess.  The
king, who heard the great commotion from the far end of the palace, remembered
the terrible warning of the fairies, and guessing what had happened, came
rushing to the tower. There he saw the princess lying in a deep, deep sleep,
and he ordered her to be carried into the finest apartment in his palace, and
to be laid upon a bed all embroidered with gold and silver.  If you had seen
her, you might have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful,
for her swooning away had not paled her complexion; her cheeks were like roses,
and her lips were like sea coral. Indeed, her eyes were shut, but she was heard
to breathe softly, which persuaded everyone that she was not dead. The king
commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep quietly until her
hour of awaking was come.  When this accident happened to the princess, the
good fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep for a hundred
years, was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand miles away, but she
quickly heard the terrible news from a little dwarf, who had one hundred mile
boots, that is boots with which he could tread over one hundred miles of ground
in a single step. The fairy came immediately, and she arrived at the palace
about an hour later, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.  The king took her
hand as she stepped out of the chariot, and they both went to look at the
sleeping princess. As the fairy was very good at thinking and planning ahead,
she realised that in one hundred years time when the princess would wake up,
she might not know what to do with herself, being all alone in this old palace.
So this was what she did: she touched with her wand everything in the palace
(except the king and queen), nannies, maids of honour, ladies of the
bedchamber, gentlemen, officers, stewards, cooks, undercooks, cleaners, guards,
with their beefeaters, pages and footmen. She also touched all the horses in
the stables and fields, the fierce guard dogs in the outer court, and pretty
little Mopsey too, the princesss little puppy, which lay by her on the bed.
Immediately, as soon as she touched them they all fell asleep, so that they
might not awaken before their princess, and that they might be ready to serve
her when she wanted them. Even the great fires in the ovens of the kitchen,
that were just then roasting partridges and pheasants, fell asleep too. All
this was done in a moment. Fairies do not take long to finish their business.
Now the king and the queen, having kissed their dear child without waking her,
went out of the palace and made an order that nobody should dare to come near
it. This, however, was not necessary, for in a quarter of an hours time there
grew up all round about the palace grounds such a vast number of trees, great
and small, bushes and brambles, entwining one within another, that neither man
nor beast could pass through; so that nothing could be seen but the very top of
the towers of the palace. Nobody doubted but the fairy had demonstrated a very
extraordinary sample of her power, that the princess, while she continued
sleeping, might have nothing to fear from any curious people.  When a hundred
years had passed by, the son of a king from another family had gone a-hunting
in that part of the country where the palace used to be. He asked: What are
those towers in the middle of that great thick wood?  Everyone answered with
the rumours that they had heard. Some said that it was a ruinous old castle,
haunted by spirits. Others, that all the sorcerers and witches of the country
used to meet there at midnight when there was a full moon. Most people believed
that an ogre lived there, and that he used take there all the little children
he could catch, so that he could eat them up whenever he pleased, without
anybody being able to follow him, as only he had the power to pass through the
wood.  The prince was all in a quandary, not knowing what to believe, when a
very good countryman said to him: May it please Your Royal Highness, it is now
about fifty years since I heard from my father, who heard my grandfather say
that there was then in this castle a princess, the most beautiful that was ever
seen; that she must sleep there a hundred years, and should only be waked by a
kings son.  The young prince was all on fire at these words, believing, without
thinking things through, that he could save the princess, and pushed on by love
and honor, he swore that moment that he would do just that.  As he rode on his
horse toward the wood, all the great trees, the bushes, and brambles gave way
to let him pass through. He walked up to the castle which he saw at the end of
a large avenue and he went into it. What rather surprised him was that none of
his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had
passed through them. However, he did not stop; a young and amorous prince is
always brave. He came into a wide, wide outer court, where everything he saw
might have frozen the most fearless person with horror. There was a most
frightful silence; the image of death everywhere showed itself, and there was
nothing to be seen but stretched-out bodies of men and animals, all seeming to
be dead.  The prince realised when he saw the red faces and pimpled noses of
the guards, that they were only asleep; and that their glasses, in which there
still remained some drops of wine, showed plainly that they had fallen asleep,
while drunk.  He then crossed a court paved with marble, went up the stairs and
came into the corridor where guards were standing, with their rifles upon their
shoulders, snoring as loud as they could. After that he went through several
rooms full of gentlemen and ladies, all asleep; some standing, others sitting.
At last he came into a chamber all gilded with gold, where he saw upon a bed
the most wonderful sight that had even met his eyes  a princess, who appeared
to be about fifteen or sixteen years of age, and whose bright and rosy beauty
was quite angelic. He approached with trembling admiration, and fell down
before her upon his knees and kissed her hand.  Now, as the evil fairys spell
was at an end, the princess opened her blue eyes for the first time in one
hundred years and looking at him said: Is it you, my prince? You have waited a
long time.  The prince, charmed with these words, and much more with the manner
in which they were spoken, knew not how to show his joy and gratitude. He
assured her that he loved her more than anyone or anything in the whole wide
world. Their conversation did not make much sense  they spoke with little
reason but a great deal of love. He was more lost for words than she, and we
need not wonder at it; she had time to think what to say to him; for it is very
probable (though history mentions nothing of it) that the good fairy, during so
long a sleep, had given her very agreeable dreams about handsome princes coming
to her rescue. In short, they talked four hours together, and yet they said not
half of what they had to say.  In the meanwhile, all the palace awakened, and
as all of them were not in love, they felt most desperately hungry after 100
years without a bite to eat. The chief lady of honor grew very impatient, and
told the princess aloud that supper was served up. The prince helped the
princess to rise. She was entirely dressed, and very magnificently too, but His
Royal Highness took care not to tell her that she was dressed in the fashion of
one hundred years ago, like his great-grandmother. She looked not a bit less
charming and beautiful for all that.  They went into the great hall of mirrors,
where they ate supper, and were served by the princess officers. The orchestra
played old tunes, but very nice ones, and after supper, without losing any
time, the priest married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief lady
of honour drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep  the princess had
had too much of it recently, and the prince left her the next morning to return
to the city, where the king was anxiously waiting for him.  The morning after
the handsome prince had married the Sleeping Beauty, he left her and returned
home to the city where his father, the king, was anxiously waiting for him.
When he reached home, the prince said that he had lost his way in the forest as
he was hunting, and that he had slept in the cottage of a farmer, who gave him
cheese and brown bread. He did not say a word about the Sleeping Beauty, let
alone how he had married her.  The king, his father, who was a good man,
believed him, but his mother could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing
that he went almost every day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse
ready for so doing, though he had slept out three or four nights together, she
began to suspect that he was married, for he lived with the princess for over
two whole years, and they had two children  the eldest of which, who was a
daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they called Day.
The queen spoke several times to her son, to ask him how he passed his time. He
never dared to trust her with his secret. He feared her, though he loved her,
for she was of the race of the ogres, and the king would never have married her
had it not been for her money; it was even whispered about the court that she
had ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever she saw little children passing
by, she had all the difficulty in the world to stop herself pouncing on them
and gobbling them up for a snack.  And so the prince would never tell her one
word about his beautiful wife and two little children.  The king died about two
years later, and although the prince was very sad, he became Lord and master,
both of the people and of himself. A month later, he announced his marriage to
the cheering crowds; and he led his beloved wife, the former Sleeping Beauty,
in a great procession to the palace. They made a magnificent entry into the
capital city, she riding between her two children.  Now she became his queen.
Soon after, the king went to make war with the Emperor Contalabutte, his
neighbour. He left his wife, the Sleeping Beauty, and his two children, Prince
Day and Princess Morning, in the care of his mother. His war went on all
summer, and after a while his mother said to the Sleeping Beauty: Why dont you
go to visit your old palace in the forest, my dear, and see that everything is
in order there? I will look after little Princess Morning and little Prince
Day.  Sleeping Beauty went to visit her old palace in the forest to see that
everything was in order there, and she left the great city, and little Princess
Morning and little Prince Day in the care of the kings mother, for she did not
know that she was an ogress who craved to eat little children for dinner.  As
soon as Sleeping Beauty was gone, the queen went into the palace kitchen.  She
said: I have an idea to eat little Morning for my dinner tomorrow.  Ah! madam!
cried the chief cook of the kitchen.  I will have it so, replied the queen (and
this she spoke in the tone of an ogress who had a strong desire to eat fresh
meat) and I will eat her with cranberry sauce.  The poor man, knowing very well
that he must not play tricks with ogresses, took his great knife and went up
into little Mornings chamber. She was then four years old, and came up to him
jumping and laughing, to take him about the neck, and ask him for some
sugar-candy. Upon which he began to weep, the great knife fell out of his hand,
and he went into the back yard, and killed a little lamb, and dressed it with
such good sauce that his mistress assured him that she had never eaten anything
so good in her life. He had at the same time taken up little Morning, and
carried her to his wife, to conceal her in a hut he had at the bottom of the
courtyard.  About eight days afterward the wicked queen said to the chief cook
of the kitchen: I will eat little Day for my supper.  He answered not a word,
being resolved to cheat her as he had done before. He went to find out little
Day, and saw him with a little sword in his hand, with which he was fencing
with a great monkey, the child being then only three years of age. He took him
up in his arms and carried him to his wife, that she might conceal him in her
chamber along with his sister, and in the room of little Day cooked up a young
goat, very tender, which the ogress again found to be wonderfully good.  So far
all was well, but one evening this wicked queen said to her chief cook of the
kitchen: I will eat Sleeping Beauty with the same sauce I had with her
children.  It was now that the poor clerk of the kitchen despaired of being
able to deceive her. The young queen was turned of twenty, not reckoning the
hundred years she had been asleep; and how to find in a beast of the size,
shape and firmness puzzled him. He decided that to save his own life, he must
cut Sleeping Beautys throat; and so he went to her palace in the forest with
the meaning to do just that. He put himself into as foul a mood as he possibly
could, and came into Sleeping Beautys room in the palace with his dagger in his
hand.  When he saw her beautiful face, he could not bring himself to kill her,
but told her, with a great deal of respect, the orders he had received from the
queen mother.  Do it, do it, said she, stretching out her neck. Execute your
orders, and then I shall go and see my children, my poor children, whom I so
much and so tenderly loved.  For after hearing of the queens orders, she
thought that they must be dead.  No, no, madam, cried the poor chief cook of
the kitchen, all in tears, you shall not die, and yet you shall see your
children again, but you must go home with me to my lodgings, where I have
concealed them, and I shall deceive the queen once more by giving her in your
place a young deer for her dinner.  And so he led her to his house, where
leaving her to embrace her children, and cry along with them, he went and
dressed a young deer, which the queen had for her supper, and devoured it with
the same appetite as if it had been Sleeping Beauty. She was so delighted with
her cruelty, and she had invented a story to tell the king, on his return, how
the mad wolves had eaten up his wife and her two children.  One evening, as she
was, according to her custom, rambling round about the courts and yards of the
palace to see if she could smell any fresh meat, she heard in a ground room,
little Prince Day crying, for his mamma was sending him to bed without supper
because he had been naughty; and she heard at the same time, little Morning
begging pardon for her brother.  The ogress presently knew the voice of
Sleeping Beauty and her children, and being quite mad that she had been
tricked, commanded the next morning, by break of day (with a most horrible
voice, which made everybody tremble), that they should bring into the middle of
the great court a large tub; which she ordered to be filled with toads, vipers,
snakes, and all sorts of serpents, in order to have thrown into it Sleeping
Beauty and her children, the chief cook of the kitchen, his wife and maid  all
whom she had given orders should be brought there with their hands tied behind
them.  They were brought out, and the executioners were just going to throw
them into the tub, when the king (who was not so soon expected) entered the
court on horseback (for he came post) and asked, with the utmost astonishment,
what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle.  No one dared to tell him.
When the ogress, all enraged to see what had happened, threw herself head first
into the tub, and was instantly gobbled up by the ugly creatures she had
ordered to be thrown into it for the others. The king was very sorry, for the
ogress had been his own mother; but he soon comforted himself with his
beautiful wife and his pretty children, and they lived happily ever after.

Quote = Once upon a time there was a poor miller who had three sons. The years
went by and the miller died, leaving nothing but his mill, his donkey, and a
cat. The eldest son took the mill, the second-born son rode off on the donkey,
and the youngest son inherited the cat.  Oh, well, said the youngest son, Ill
eat this cat, and make some mittens out of his fur. Then I will have nothing
left in the world and shall die of hunger.  The cat was listening to his master
complain like this, but he pretended not to have heard anything. Instead, he
put on a serious face and said: Do not look so sad, master. Just give me a bag
and a pair of boots, and I will show you that you did not receive such a poor
inheritance in me.  The cats master had often seen him play a great many
cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or
hide himself in the grain, and pretend to be dead. Thinking this over, he
thought that it wasnt impossible that the cat could help him after all, so he
gave the cat his bag and spent his last pennies on ordering a fine pair of
boots to be made especially for the cat.  The cat looked very gallant in his
boots, and putting his bag around his neck, he held the strings of it in his
two fore paws and lay by a rabbit warren, which was home to a great many
rabbits.  He put bran and corn into his bag, and stretching as if he were dead,
waited for some young rabbits, still not acquainted with the deceits of the
world, to come and rummage in his bag for the bran and corn.  Puss in BootsNot
long after he lay down, he had what he wanted. A rash and foolish young rabbit
jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss immediately drew close the strings and
caught him. Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace and asked to speak
with his majesty. He was shown upstairs into the kings apartment, and making a
low bow, said to him: I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren, which my
noble lord, the Marquis of Carabas (for that was the title which puss was
pleased to give his master) has commanded me to present to your majesty from
him.  Tell thy master, said the king, that I thank him and that he does me a
great deal of pleasure.  Another time he went and hid himself among a
cornfield, holding still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into
it he drew the strings and so caught them both. He went and made a present of
these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit. The king, in like
manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money
for drink.  In this way, the cat continued for two or three months to bring
presents to the king, always saying that they were from his master, the Marquis
of Carabas. One day in particular, he heard at the palace that the king was
planning to drive in his carriage along the river bank, taking with him his
daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world.  Puss in Boots said to his
master: If you will follow my advice, your fortune is made. You have nothing
else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in the place that I shall
show you, and leave the rest to me.  The millers son did what the cat advised
him to, without knowing why or wherefore. While he was washing, the king passed
by, and the cat began to cry out: Help! Help! My Lord, Marquis of Carabas, is
going to be drowned!  Picture-5At this noise the king put his head out of the
coach window, and finding it was the cat who had so often brought him such good
game, commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his
Lordship, the Marquis of Carabas. While they were drawing the poor Marquis out
of the river, the cat came up to the coach and told the king that while his
master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes,
though he had cried out: Thieves! Thieves! Several times, as loud as he could.
This cunning cat had hidden the clothes under a great stone. The king
immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his
best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.  The king was very pleased to meet
the Marquis of Carabas, and the fine clothes he had given him suited him
extremely well, for although poor, he was a handsome and a well built fellow.
The kings daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas
had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she
fell in love with him to distraction. The king invited him to sit in the coach
and ride along with them, with the lifeguards in glittering uniform trotting
along side. The cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed,
marched on before, and meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow,
he said to them: Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the king
that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, those soldiers
will chop you up like herbs for the pot.  The king did not fail asking of the
mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.  To my Lord Marquis of
Carabas, answered they altogether, for the cats threats had made them terribly
afraid.  You see, sir, said the Marquis, this is a meadow which never fails to
yield a plentiful harvest every year.  The master cat, who went still on
before, met with some reapers, and said to them: Good people, you who are
reaping, if you do not tell the king that all this corn belongs to the Marquis
of Carabas, you shall be chopped up like herbs for the pot.  The king, who
passed by a moment after, wished to know to whom all that corn, which he then
saw, did belong.  To my Lord Marquis of Carabas, replied the reapers, and the
king was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he
congratulated.  Then the king said: Let us now go to your castle.  The millers
son, not knowing what to reply, looked at puss who said: If Your Majesty will
but wait an hour, I will go on before and order the castle to be made ready for
you.  With that, she jumped away and went to the castle of a great ogre and
asked to see him, saying he could not pass so near his home without having the
honour of paying his respects to him.  The ogre received him as civilly as an
ogre could do, and made him sit down.  I have been assured, said the cat, that
you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures
as you wish; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant,
and the like.  That is true, answered the ogre very briskly, and to convince
you, you shall see me now become a lion.  Puss was so terrified at the sight of
a lion so near him that he immediately climbed up the curtains, not without
difficulty, because his boots were no use to him for climbing. A little while
after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down
and admitted he had been very much frightened.  However, said the cat, I fear
that you will not be able to save yourself even in the form of a lion, for the
king is coming with his army and means to destroy you.  The ogre looked out of
the window and saw the king waiting outside with his soldiers, and said: What
shall I do? How shall I save myself?  Puss replied: If you can also change
yourself into something very small, then you can hide.  In an instant, the ogre
turned himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner
saw this but he fell upon him and ate him up.  Puss, who heard the noise of His
Majestys coach running over the drawbridge, ran out and said to the king: Your
Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.  What! My Lord
Marquis, cried the king. Does this castle also belong to you? There can be
nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it.
Let us go into it, if you please.  The Marquis gave his hand to the princess,
and followed the king, who went first. They passed into a spacious hall, where
they found a magnificent rum punch, which the ogre had prepared for his
friends, who were that very day to visit him. The friends, however, dared not
to enter, knowing that the king was there. His Majesty was perfectly charmed
with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who
had fallen violently in love with him, and seeing the vast estate he possessed,
said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses: If you do not, my Lord
Marquis, become my son in law, it will be of your own choosing.  The Marquis,
making several low bows, accepted the honour which His Majesty conferred upon
him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the princess.  Puss became a
great lord, and never ran after mice anymore, except for pleasure.

Title = Beauty and the Beast
Author = Beauty
Quote = A long time ago, in a far away land, a merchant was returning home
after a long journey. As night fell, he entered a deep forest. His head was
full of thoughts of his six daughters. He had left home in summer, and now he
was returning in deep winter. The most bitter sleet and snow came down, and his
horse stumbled on a patch of ice. He heard wolves howling, and soon he realised
that he was lost.  At last, he saw some sort of track. At the beginning it was
rough and slippery, but soon it led him into an avenue of orange trees covered
with flowers and fruit  but here there was no snow.  He saw a flight of stone
steps. He went up them into a great castle. Inside he passed through several
splendid rooms.  Everywhere in the castle there was a deep silence. At last, he
stopped in a small room where a fire was burning. He lay down on a couch and
very soon fell into a sweet sleep.  He woke up feeling hungry. He was still
alone, but a good dinner had been laid on a little table. He began to eat,
hoping that he might soon have an chance to thank his kind host, whoever it
might be - but no one appeared.  Then he went down into the garden, and though
it was winter everywhere else, here the sun shone, and the birds sang, and the
flowers bloomed, and the air was soft and sweet. The path had a hedge of roses
on each side of it, and the merchant thought he had never seen or smelled such
beautiful flowers. Then he remembered a promise he had made to his youngest
daughter, who was so lovely that everyone knew her as Beauty. Before setting
out on his journey, he had asked his daughters what presents they would like
him to bring back for them.  The five eldest wished for jewels and fine
clothes, but Beauty asked only for a single rose. Now, as he stopped to pick a
rose to take home to Beauty, he was startled by a strange noise behind him.
Turning around, he saw a frightful ugly Beast, which seemed to be very angry
and sad and said in a terrible voice, Who said that you could pick my roses?
Was it not enough that I let you say in my palace and was kind to you? This is
the way you thank me, by stealing my flowers! You shall not go unpunished!  The
merchant was terrified by these furious words. He dropped the fatal rose, and
throwing himself on his knees, cried, Pardon me, noble sir. I am truly grateful
to you for your kindness. I could not imagine that you would mind so much if I
took such a little thing as a rose.  The Beast was still furious, however, and
cried, Excuses and flattery will not save you from the death you deserve!
Alas! Thought the merchant. My daughters rose has put me in this terrible
danger.  He began to tell the Beast of his journey, not forgetting to mention
how Beauty had asked him for a rose.  I beg you to forgive me, for I meant no
harm, he pleaded.  The Beast thought for a moment, and then he said, in a less
terrible voice, I will forgive you on one condition  that is if you will give
me one of your daughters.  Ah! Cried the merchant. What excuse could I invent
to bring her here?  No excuse! Answered the Beast. She must come willingly. Go
home. I give you a month to see if one of your daughters will save you. If none
of them is willing to come to me, you must come back alone. Do not think that
you can hide from me, for if you do not keep your word I will come and fetch
you!  The poor merchant, more dead than alive, went to the stable where his
horse was ready for his journey. It carried him off so swiftly that in an
instant he had lost sight of the palace, and he was still wrapped in gloomy
thoughts when it stopped before the door of his house.  His daughters rushed to
meet him. At first he told them nothing of the Beast, but as he gave Beauty her
the rose he said sadly, Here is what you asked me to bring you; you little know
what it has cost.  Later that evening he told his family of his adventures from
beginning to end, and then his daughters wept loudly. The girls were very angry
with Beauty, and said to her that it was all her fault, and complained bitterly
that they should have to suffer for her foolish wish.  Poor Beauty said to
them, Who could have guessed that asking for a rose in the middle of summer
would cause so much misery? But as I made this mistake, it is only right that I
should be the one to suffer for it. I will go back to the Beast with father.
When the fatal day came she said goodbye to her sisters and everything she
loved. She mounted a horse together with her father, and it seemed to fly
rather than gallop. They soon reached the avenue of orange trees, where statues
were holding flaming torches, and when they got nearer to the palace, music
sounded softly from the courtyard.  Her father led her to the little room where
he had stayed, and there they found a splendid fire burning, and a delicious
supper set out on the table.  After they had finished their meal they heard the
Beasts footsteps approaching, and Beauty clung to her father. When the ugly
Beast appeared she tried hard to hide her terror, and she nodded to him
politely.  This clearly pleased the Beast. After looking at her he said, in a
voice that might have struck fear into the boldest of hearts, Good evening, old
man. Good evening, Beauty.  The merchant was too terrified to reply, but Beauty
answered sweetly, Good evening, Beast.  Have you come willingly? Asked the
Beast.  Beauty answered bravely that she had come willingly to save her father.
I am pleased with you, said the Beast. As for you, old man, he added, turning
to the merchant, at sunrise tomorrow you will go.  Then turning to Beauty, he
said, Take your father into the next room and help him to choose presents for
your sisters. Take everything they would wish for.  Then he left them saying,
Goodbye Beauty. Goodbye old man.  In the next room they found splendid dresses
fit for a queen. When Beauty opened the cupboards she was quite dazzled by the
gorgeous jewels that lay in heaps upon every shelf. After choosing a vast
quantity, she opened the last chest, which was full of gold.  I think, father,
she said, that gold will be more useful to you. We had better take out the
other things again, and fill the trunks with gold. So they did this; and at
last the trunks were so heavy that an elephant could not have carried them!
The Beast was making fun of us, cried the merchant. He pretended to give us
these things, knowing that I could not carry them away.  Let us wait and see,
answered Beauty.  At sunrise, they went down into the courtyard, where two
horses were waiting; one loaded with the two trunks, the other for the merchant
to ride. As soon as he climbed into the saddle, he went off at such a pace that
Beauty lost sight of him in an instant. Then she began to cry and she went back
to her room and fell into a deep sleep.  She dreamed that she was walking by a
stream when a young prince came up to her and said, in a voice that went
straight to her heart, Ah, Beauty! You are not so unlucky as you suppose. Only
try to find me, no matter how I may be disguised, as I love you dearly. Make me
happy and you shall be happy. Be as true-hearted as you are beautiful, and we
shall have nothing left to wish for.  What can I do, prince, to make you happy?
Said Beauty.  Do not trust your eyes, he answered, and set me free from my
misery.  When Beauty awoke, she began to think about the charming prince she
had seen in her dream.  He said I could make him happy. Said Beauty to herself.
It seems that this horrible Beast keeps him a prisoner. How can I set him free?
I dont understand it. After all, it was only a dream, so why should I worry
about it?  She got up to explore the castle, but she did not see anyone or hear
any sound, and she began to find it rather dull.  Only that evening, after
supper, she heard the Beast coming, and she trembled with fear at what it might
do. But he only said, Good evening, Beauty.  She answered cheerfully and
managed to hide her terror. He spoke politely to her for about an hour, and
asked her all about her life with her family.  Then he said in a gruff voice,
Do you love me, Beauty? Will you marry me?  Oh! What shall I say? Cried Beauty,
for she was afraid to make the Beast angry by refusing.  Say 'yes' or 'no'
without fear, he replied.  Oh! No, Beast, said Beauty, hastily.  Since you will
not, goodnight Beauty, he said.  And she answered, Goodnight, Beast, very glad
to find that he had not attacked her. After he was gone, she was very soon in
bed asleep, and dreaming of her unknown prince. He came to her and said to her,
Ah, Beauty! Why are you so unkind to me? I fear I will be unhappy for many a
long day still.  The next morning, she decided to amuse herself in the garden,
for the sun shone, and all the fountains were playing. When she was tired she
went back to the palace, and found a new room full of rare birds, so tame that
they flew to Beauty as soon as they saw her, and perched upon her shoulders and
her head.  Some of them were parrots and cockatoos that could talk, and they
greeted Beauty by name.  "Pretty little creatures, she said. Oh how I wish that
your cage was nearer to my room, that I could often hear you sing!" When she
left, she opened a door and found that it led straight into her own room.
After supper, the Beast paid her his usual visit, and before he left he asked
her as before, Beauty, will you marry me? And when she refused, he gave her a
gruff, Goodnight and left her. The days passed, and every evening the Beast
asked her the same question and she gave him the same answer.  Beauty felt that
when she said, No, Beast, he went away quite sad. But her happy dreams of the
handsome young prince soon made her forget the poor Beast.  Her prince always
told to let her heart guide her, and not her eyes, and many other equally
baffling things which she could not understand.  At last, happy as she was,
Beauty began to long for her family. One night, seeing her look very sad, the
Beast asked her what was the matter. Beauty was no longer afraid of him. Now
she knew that he was really gentle in spite of his ferocious looks and his
dreadful voice. She answered that she was longing to see her home once more.
When he heard this, the Beast cried miserably, Ah! Beauty, have you the heart
to leave an unhappy Beast like me? Is it because you hate me that you want to
escape?  No, dear Beast, answered Beauty softly. I do not hate you, and I
should be very sorry never to see you anymore, but I long to see my father
again. Only let me go for two months, and I promise to come back to you and
stay for the rest of my life.  The Beast replied with a sigh, I cannot refuse
you anything you ask, even though it should cost me my life. You may go. But
remember your promise and come back when the two months are over, or you may be
sorry, for if you do not come in good time you will find your faithful Beast
dead.  Then she went to bed, but could hardly sleep for joy. When at last she
did begin to dream of her beloved prince she saw him stretched upon a grassy
bank, sad and weary, and hardly like himself.  What is the matter? She cried.
He looked at her reproachfully, and said, How can you ask me, cruel one?  Ah!
Dont be so sad, cried Beauty. I am only going to let my father know that I am
safe and happy. I have promised my Beast that I shall come back. I would not
cause him pain by breaking my word. He told me he would die if did not keep my
promise to him.  What do you care for an ugly Beast? Asked the prince.  Oh,
said Beauty, It is not his fault that he is so ugly. He is a very kind beast.
Just then, she heard someone speaking not very far away. She got up and then
she suddenly heard her fathers voice. She rushed out and greeted him. She was
home. Her sisters were quite astonished to see her, and there was no end to
their questions about her life with the Beast.  Then Beauty asked her father
what he thought could be the meaning of her strange dreams. After much thought,
he answered, You tell me yourself that The Beast, frightful as he is, loves you
dearly and is kind and gentle to you. I think the prince means that you should
do as the Beast wishes in spite of his ugliness.  But Beautys thoughts were
full of her handsome dream prince, and she could not imagine marrying the
Beast.  When the two months were over, Beautys sisters begged her not to return
to the ugly beast, but to stay with her family. At first she could not refuse
them, and she stayed on for a few days more. Then one night she had a different
dream from usual. She saw not her prince, but the Beast. He was lying in a cave
and he looked ill and in pain. Then Beauty remember his words that he might die
if she did not stay true to her word.  The next day, Beauty said goodbye to her
father and all her sisters, and as soon as she was in bed she turned her ring
around upon her finger, and said firmly, I wish to go back to see my Beast
again.  She fell asleep instantly, and only woke up to hear the clock saying,
Beauty, Beauty, twelve times in its musical voice, which told her at once that
she was in the palace once more. Everything was just as before, and her birds
were so glad to see her! Beauty thought she had never known such a long day,
for she was so anxious to see the Beast again, that she felt as if suppertime
would never come.  When it did come and no Beast appeared she was really
frightened. She ran down into the garden to search for him. Up and down the
paths and avenues ran poor Beauty, calling him in vain, for no one answered.
At last, quite tired, she stopped for a minutes rest, and saw that she was
standing opposite a cave, and in it lay the Beast, asleep. Quite glad to have
found him, she ran up and stroked his head, but to her horror, he did not move
or open his eyes.  Oh! He is dead, and it is all my fault, said Beauty, crying
bitterly.  But then, looking at him again, she fancied he still breathed. She
fetched some water from the nearest fountain and sprinkled it over his face.
Slowly, he began to open his eyes.  Ah Beauty, he said faintly, now you see
what happens when you do not keep your word.  Oh! Beast, she cried. I never
knew how much I loved you until now, when I feared I was too late to save your
life.  Can you really love such an ugly creature as I am? asked the Beast. You
only came just in time. I was dying because I thought you had forgotten your
promise. Go back now and rest, I shall see you by and by.  Beauty went back to
the palace, where supper was awaiting her; and afterward the Beast came in as
usual, and asked about the time she had spent with her family, and if they had
all been very glad to see her.  When at last the time came for him to go, and
he asked, as he had so often asked before, Beauty, will you marry me? She
answered softly, Yes, dear Beast.  As she spoke a blaze of light sprang up
before the windows of the palace; fireworks crackled and guns banged, and
across the avenue of orange trees, in letters all made of fireflies, was
written, Long live the prince and his bride.  Beauty meant to ask the Beast
what it all meant, but he had gone. In his place stood her long-loved prince!
At the same moment, two ladies entered the room.  Both were splendidly dressed,
but one especially so. Her companion said, Well, Queen, this is Beauty, who has
had the courage to rescue your son from the terrible magic spell that turned
him into a Beast. They love one another, and your consent to their marriage is
all they need to make them perfectly happy.  I agree with all my heart, cried
the queen. Then she tenderly embraced Beauty and the prince.  Now, said the
fairy to Beauty, I suppose you would like me to send for your father and
sisters?  She did so. The marriage was celebrated the very next day, and Beauty
and the prince lived happily ever after.  And that was the story of Beauty and
the Beast.

title = Hansel and Gretel 
Author = Hansel
Quote = ONCE upon a time there dwelled on the outskirts of a large forest a poor
woodcutter with his wife and two children; the boy was called Hansel, and the
girl Gretel. He always had little enough to live on, and once, when times were
bad, they had to get by with one piece of bread and butter each. One night, as
he was tossing about in bed, full of cares and worry, he sighed and said to his
wife, Whats to become of us? How are we to feed our poor children, now that we
have nothing more for ourselves?  Ill tell you what, husband, answered the
woman, early tomorrow morning well take the children out into the thickest part
of the wood. There we shall light a fire for them and give them each a piece of
bread; then well go on to our work and leave them alone. They wont be able to
find their way home, and we shall be rid of them.  No, wife, said her husband,
that I wont do; how could I find it in my heart to leave my children alone in
the wood? The wild beasts would soon come and tear them to pieces.  Oh! You
fool, said she, then we must all four die of hunger, and you may just as well
go and saw the boards for our coffins. They argued and argued, until he agreed
that they must get rid of Hansel and Gretel. But I cant help feeling sorry for
the poor children, added the husband.  The children, too, had not been able to
sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father.
Gretel wept bitterly and spoke to Hansel, Now its all up with us.  No, no,
Gretel, said Hansel, dont fret yourself; Ill be able to find a way to escape,
no fear. When the old people had fallen asleep he got up, slipped on his little
coat, opened the back door and stole out. The moon was shining clearly, and the
white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like bits of silver.
Hansel bent down and filled his pocket with as many of them as he could cram
in. Then he went back and said to Gretel, Be comforted, my dear little sister,
and go to sleep. God will not desert us, and he lay down in bed again.  At
daybreak, even before the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children,
Get up, you lie-abeds, were all going to the forest to fetch wood. She gave
them each a bit of bread and said, Theres something for your luncheon, but dont
you eat it up beforehand, for its all youll get. Gretel took the bread under
her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out
together on the way to the forest. After they had walked a little, Hansel stood
still and looked back at the house, and this manoeuvre he repeated again and
again. His father observed him, and said, Hansel, what are you gazing at there?
Why do you always remain behind? Take care, and dont lose your footing.  Oh!
father, said Hansel, I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on
the roof, waving me a farewell.  The woman exclaimed, What a donkey you are!
That isn't your kitten, thats the morning sun shining on the chimney. But
Hansel had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the
white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.  When they had reached the
middle of the forest the father said, Now children, go and fetch a lot of wood,
and Ill light a fire that you may not feel cold. Hansel and Gretel heaped up
brushwood until they had made a pile nearly the size of a small hill. The
brushwood was set fire to, and when the flames leaped high the woman said, Now
lie down at the fire, children, and rest yourselves: We are going into the
forest to cut down wood, and when we've finished well come back and fetch you.
Hansel and Gretel sat down beside the fire, and at midday ate their little bits
of bread. They heard the strokes of the axe, so they thought their father was
quite near. But it was no axe they heard, but a bough he had tied on a dead
tree, and that was blown about by the wind. When they had sat for a long time
their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When they awoke at
last, it was pitch dark. Gretel began to cry, and said, How are we ever to get
out of the wood?  Hansel comforted her. Wait a bit, he said, until the moon is
up, and then well find our way sure enough. When the full moon had risen, he
took his sister by the hand and followed the pebbles, which shone like new
threepenny bits, and showed them the path. They walked on through the night,
and at daybreak reached their fathers house again. They knocked at the door,
and when the woman opened it she exclaimed, You naughty children, what a time
you've slept in the wood to! We thought you were never going to come back. The
father rejoiced, for his conscience had reproached him for leaving his children
behind by themselves.  Not long afterwards there was again great dearth in the
land, and the children heard their mother address their father thus in bed one
night, Everything is eaten up once more; we have only half a loaf in the house,
and when thats gone its all up with us. The children must be gotten rid of;
well lead them deeper into the wood this time, so that they wont be able to
find their way out again. There is no other way of saving ourselves. The mans
heart smote him heavily.  He thought, Surely it would be better to share the
last bite with ones children! But his wife wouldn't listen to his arguments,
and did nothing but scold and reproach him. If a man yields once, hes done for,
and so, because he had given in the first time, he was forced to do so the
second.  The children were awake again, and had heard the conversation. When
the old people were asleep Hansel got up, and wanted to go out and pick up
pebbles again, as he had done the first time; but the woman had barred the
door, and Hansel couldn't get out. But he consoled his little sister, and said,
Dont cry, Gretel, and sleep peacefully, for God is sure to help us.  At early
dawn the woman came and made the children get up. They received their bit of
bread, but it was even smaller than the time before. On the way to the wood
Hansel crumbled it in his pocket, and every few minutes he stood still and
dropped a crumb on the ground. Hansel, what are you stopping and looking about
you for? Said the father.  Im looking back at my little pigeon, which is
sitting on the roof waving me a farewell, answered Hansel.  Fool! said the
wife; that isn't your pigeon, its the morning sun glittering on the chimney.
But Hansel gradually threw all his crumbs on the path. The woman led the
children still deeper into the forest farther than they had ever been in their
lives before. Then a big fire was lit again, and the mother said, Just sit down
there children, and if youre tired you can sleep a bit; were going into the
forest to cut down wood, and in the evening when were finished well come back
to fetch you.  At midday Gretel divided her bread with Hansel, for he had
strewn his all along their path. Then they fell asleep, evening passed away,
and nobody came to the poor children. They didnt awake until it was pitch dark,
and Hansel comforted his sister, saying, Only wait, Gretel, 'til the moon
rises, then we shall see the bread-crumbs I scattered along the path; they will
show us the way back to the house.  When the moon appeared they got up, but
they found no crumbs, for the thousands of birds that fly about the woods and
fields had picked them all up. Never mind, said Hansel to Gretel, youll see
well find a way out, but all the same they did not. They wandered about the
whole night and the next day, from morning until evening, but they could not
find a path out of the wood. They were very hungry too, for they had nothing to
eat but a few berries they found growing on the ground. At last they were so
tired that their legs refused to carry them any longer, so they lay down under
a tree and fell fast asleep.  On the third morning after they had left their
fathers house they set about their wandering again, but only got deeper and
deeper into the wood, and now they felt that if help did not come to them soon
they must perish. At midday they saw a beautiful little snow-white bird sitting
on a branch, which sang so sweetly that they stopped still and listened to it.
When its song was finished it flapped its wings and flew on in front of them.
They followed it and came to a little house, on the roof of which it perched;
and when they came quite near they saw that the cottage was made of bread and
roofed with cakes, while the window was made of transparent sugar. Now well set
to, said Hansel, and have a regular blow-out.Ill eat a bit of the roof, and
you, Gretel, can eat some of the window, which youll find a sweet morsel.
Hansel stretched up his hand and broke off a little bit of the roof to see what
it was like, and Gretel went to the casement and began to nibble at it.
Thereupon a shrill voice called out from the room inside, Nibble, nibble,
little mouse. Whos nibbling my house?  The children answered, 'Tis heavens own
child, the tempest wild, and went on eating, without putting themselves about.
Hansel, who thoroughly appreciated the roof, tore down a big bit of it, while
Gretel pushed out a whole round window pane, and sat down the better to enjoy
it. Suddenly the door opened, and an ancient dame, leaning on a staff, hobbled
out. Hansel and Gretel were so terrified that they let what they had in their
hands fall.  The old woman shook her head and said, Oh, ho! You dear children,
who led you here? Just come in and stay with me, no ill shall befall you. She
took them both by the hand, led them into the house, and laid a most sumptuous
dinner before them; milk and sugared pancakes, with apples and nuts. After they
had finished, two beautiful little white beds were prepared for them, and when
Hansel and Gretel lay down in them they felt as if they had gone to heaven.
The old woman had appeared to be most friendly, but she was really an old witch
who had waylaid the children, and had only built the little bread house in
order to lure them in. When anyone came into her power; she killed, cooked and
ate him, and held a regular feast day for the occasion. Now witches have red
eyes, and cannot see far, but like beasts, they have a keen sense of smell, and
know when human beings pass by. When Hansel and Gretel fell into her hands she
laughed maliciously, and said jeeringly, Ive got them now; they shan't escape
me.  Early in the morning, before the children were awake, she rose up, and
when she saw them both sleeping so peacefully, with their round rosy cheeks,
she muttered to herself, Thatll be a dainty bite. Then she seized Hansel with
her bony hand and carried him into a little stable, and barred the door on him.
He might have screamed as much as he liked, for it would do him no good. Then
she went to Gretel, shook her until she awoke, and cried, Get up, you lazy
bones, fetch water and cook something for your brother. When hes fat Ill eat
him up. Gretel began to cry bitterly, but it was of no use; she had to do what
the wicked witch bade her.  So the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but
Gretel got nothing but crab shells. Every morning the old woman hobbled out to
the stable and cried, Hansel, put out your finger, that I may feel if you are
getting fat. But Hansel always stretched out a bone, and the old dame, whose
eyes were dim, couldnt see it. Thinking always it was Hansels finger, she
wondered why he fattened so slowly. When four weeks had passed and Hansel still
remained thin, she lost patience and determined to wait no longer.  Hi, Gretel,
she called to the girl, "Be quick and get some water. Hansel may be fat or
thin, Im going to kill him tomorrow and cook him." Oh! How the poor little
sister sobbed as she carried the water, and how the tears rolled down her
cheeks!  Kind heaven help us now! She cried. If only the wild beasts in the
wood had eaten us, then at least we should have died together.  Just hold your
peace, said the old hag, it wont help you.  Early in the morning, Gretel had to
go out and hang up the kettle full of water, and light the fire. First well
bake, said the old dame. Ive heated the oven already and kneaded the dough. She
pushed Gretel out to the oven, from which fiery flames were already issuing.
Creep in, said the witch, and see if its properly heated, so that we can shove
in the bread. When she had got Gretel in she meant to close the oven and let
the girl bake, that she might eat her up too. But Gretel perceived her
intention, and said, I dont know how Im to do it; how do I get in?  You silly
goose! Said the hag. The opening is big enough, see, I could get in myself, and
she crawled toward it, and poked her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a
shove that sent her right in, shut the iron door, and drew the bolt. Gracious!
How she yelled; it was quite horrible, but Gretel fled and the wretched old
woman was left to perish miserably.  Gretel flew straight to Hansel, opened the
little stable door and cried, Hansel, we are free; the old witch is dead! Then
Hansel sprang like a bird out of a cage when the door is opened. How they
rejoiced, fell on each others necks, jumped for joy, and kissed one another! As
they had no longer any cause for fear, they went in the old hags house, and
here they found, in every corner of the room, boxes with pearls and precious
stones. These are even better than pebbles, said Hansel, and crammed his
pockets full of them. Gretel said, I too will bring something home, and she
filled her apron full.  Now, said Hansel, lets go and get well away from the
witchs wood. When they had wandered about for some hours they came to a big
lake. We cant get over, said Hansel, I see no bridge of any sort or kind.  Yes,
and theres no ferry boat either, answered Gretel. But look, there swims a white
duck. If I ask her shell help us over, and she called out, Here are two
children, mournful very, seeing neither bridge nor ferry; take us upon your
white back, and row us over, quack, quack!  The duck swam towards them, and
Hansel got on her back and bade his little sister sit beside him. No, answered
Gretel, we should be too heavy a load for the duck. She shall carry us across
separately. The good bird did this, and when they were landed safely on the
other side, and had gone for a while, the wood became more and more familiar to
them, and at length they saw their fathers house in the distance. Then they set
off to run, and bounding into the room fell on their fathers neck. The man had
not passed a happy hour since he left them in the wood, and the woman had died.
Gretel shook out her apron so that the pearls and precious stones rolled about
the room, and Hansel threw down one handful after the other out of his pocket.
Thus all their troubles were ended, and they lived happily ever afterwards.

title = The Brave Little Tailor 
Author = Brave
quote = One summers morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the
window. He was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came a
peasant woman down the street crying, "Good jams, cheap! Good jams, cheap!"
This rang pleasantly in the tailors ears. He stretched his delicate head out of
the window, and called, "Come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of
your goods." The woman came up the three steps to the tailor with her heavy
basket, and he made her unpack all the pots for him. He inspected each one,
lifted it up, put his nose to it, and at length said, "The jam seems to me to
be good. Ill buy a jar." The woman, who had hoped to sell far more jam, gave
him what he wanted, but went away grumbling.  "Now, this jam shall be blessed
by God," cried the little tailor, "and give me health and strength," so he
brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself a piece right across the
loaf and spread the jam over it. "This wont taste bitter," said he, "but I will
just finish the jacket before I take a bite." He laid the bread near him, sewed
on, and in his joy, made bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell
of the sweet jam rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and
they were attracted and descended on it in hosts. "Hey! Who invited you?" Said
the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,
understood no German, and came back again in ever increasing companies. The
little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the
hole under his work table, and saying, "Wait, and I will give it to you,"
struck it mercilessly on them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay
before him no fewer than seven flies, dead and with legs stretched out.  The
tailor looked at the flies that he had killed, and could not help admiring his
own bravery. "The whole town shall know of this!" The little tailor hastened to
cut himself a belt, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters, "Seven
dead at one stroke!" "What, the town? The whole world shall hear of it!" He
exclaimed. and his heart wagged with joy like a lambs tail. The tailor put on
the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his
workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away, he looked around
the house to see if there was anything which he could take with him; however,
he found nothing but an old cheese, and that he put in his pocket. In front of
the door he observed a bird which had caught itself in the thicket. It had to
go into his pocket with the cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he
was light and nimble, he felt no tiredness. The road led him up a mountain, and
when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking
peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him, and
said, "Good day, comrade. So you are sitting there overlooking the widespread
world! I am just on my way there, and want to try my luck. How about you come
with me?" The giant looked contemptuously at the tailor, and said, "You wretch!
You miserable creature!" "Oh, indeed?" Answered the little tailor, and
unbuttoned his coat, showing the giant the belt. "There may you read what kind
of a man I am!" The giant read, "Seven dead at one stroke," and thought that
they had been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little
respect for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took
a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out of it.
"Do that," said the giant, "if you have strength." "Is that all?" Said the
tailor. "That is childs play!" He put his hand into his pocket, brought out the
soft cheese, and pressed it until the liquid ran out of it. The giant did not
know what to say, and could not believe it of the little man. Then the giant
picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it.
"Now, little mite of a man, do that," "Well thrown," said the tailor, "but
after all the stone came down to earth again. I will throw you one which shall
never come back at all," and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the
bird, and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty, rose,
flew away and did not come back. "How does that shot please you, comrade?"
Asked the tailor. "You can certainly throw," said the giant, "but now we will
see if you are able to carry anything properly." He took the little tailor to a
mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said, "If you are
strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest." "Readily,"
answered the little man, "take you the trunk on your shoulders, and I will
raise up the branches and twigs; after all, they are the heaviest." The giant
took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and
the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the
little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and
whistled the song, "Three tailors rode forth from the gate," as if carrying the
tree were childs play. The giant, after he had dragged the heavy burden part of
the way, could go no further, and cried, "Now I shall have to let the tree
fall!" The tailor sprang nimbly down, seized the tree with both arms as if he
had been carrying it, and said to the giant, "You are such a great fellow, and
yet cannot even carry the tree!" The giant said, "If you are such a brave
fellow, come with me into our cave and spend the night with us." The little
tailor was willing, and followed him. When they went into the cave, other
giants were sitting there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in
his hand and was eating it. The little tailor looked around and thought, "It is
much more spacious here than in my workshop." The giant showed him a bed, and
said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too big for the
little tailor so he did not lie down in it, but crept into a corner. When it
was midnight, and the giant thought that the little tailor was lying in a sound
sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar, cut through the bed with one blow, and
thought he had finished off the grasshopper of a man for good. With the
earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the
little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly.
The giants were terrified, they were afraid that he would strike them all dead,
and ran away in a great hurry.  The little tailor went onward, always following
his own pointed nose. After he had walked for a long time, he came to the
courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and
fell asleep. Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all
sides. They read on his belt, "Seven dead with one stroke." "Ah!" Said they.
"What does the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a
mighty lord." Soon the tailor was brought before the king who had a request to
make of him.  In the forest roams a magical horse with one horn  a unicorn,
which does great harm attacking people all around. If you can can rid me of
this unicorn, you shall have the hand of my daughter in marriage and half my
kingdom. The tailor thought to himself, It is not every day that I receive an
offer such as that, and he replied, "I do not fear one unicorn. Seven at one
blow, is my kind of affair." He took a rope and an axe with him, went forth
into the forest. The unicorn soon came towards him, and rushed directly on the
tailor, as if it would gore him with its horn without more ado. "Softly,
softly; it cant be done as quickly as that," said he, and stood still and
waited until the animal was quite close, and then sprang nimbly behind the
tree. The unicorn ran against the tree with all its strength, and stuck its
horn so fast in the trunk that it had not the strength enough to draw it out
again - and thus it was caught. "Now, I have got it," said the tailor, and came
out from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his axe
he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the beast away
and took it to the king. But the king was sorry that he had promised his
daughter to the little man, and made another demand. Before the wedding the
tailor was to catch him a wild boar that made great havoc in the forest. And so
the taylor went into the forest where the boar was roaming.  When the boar saw
the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and sharp tusks, and was about to
throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was
near and up to the window at once, and in one bound, out again. The boar ran
after him, but the tailor ran around outside and shut the door behind it. The
raging beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,
was caught. The hero went to the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not,
obliged to keep his promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom.
The wedding was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor
a king was made.  After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his
dreams at night, "Boy, make me the jacket, and patch the trousers." The next
morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her get
rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her
and said, "Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants shall stand
outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind him, and take him on
board a ship which shall carry him into the wide world." The woman was
satisfied with this; but the kings armour-bearer, who had heard all, was
friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot. "Ill put a
screw into that business," said the little tailor. At night he went to bed with
his wife at the usual time, and when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she
got up, opened the door, and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was
only pretending to be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice, "Boy, make me
the jacket, and patch the trousers... I smote seven at one blow, I killed two
giants, I brought away one unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear
those who are standing outside the room?" When these men heard the tailor
speaking thus, they were overcome by a great fear, and ran as if the wild
huntsman were behind them, and none of them would venture anything further
against him. So the little tailor remained a king to the end of his life.  

[4028]
title = King Thrushbeard
Author = King
quote = A king had a daughter who was beautiful beyond all measure, but so
proud and haughty that no suitor was good enough for her. She sent away one
after the other, and ridiculed them as well.  Once, the king made a great feast
and invited from far and near, all the young men likely to marry. They were all
marshaled in a row according to their rank and standing. First came the kings,
then the grand dukes, then the princes, the earls, the barons, and the gentry.
The kings daughter was led through the ranks, but to each one she had some
objection to make; one was too fat, "the wine barrel," she said. Another was
too tall, "and long and thin has little in." The third was too short, "and
short and thick is never quick." The fourth was too pale, "as pale as death."
The fifth too red, "a fighting cock." The sixth was not straight enough, "a
green log dried behind the stove." So she had something to say against each
one, but she made herself especially merry over a good king who stood quite
high up in the row, and whose chin had grown a little crooked. "Look," she
cried and laughed, "he has a chin like a thrushs beak." And from that time on,
he got the name of King Thrushbeard.  But the old king, when he saw that his
daughter did nothing but mock the people, and despised all the suitors who were
gathered there, was very angry, and swore that she should have for her husband
the very first beggar that came to his doors.  A few days afterwards a fiddler
came and sang beneath the windows, trying to earn a few pennies. When the king
heard him, he said, "Let him come up." So the fiddler came in, in his dirty,
ragged clothes, and sang before the king and his daughter. When he had finished
he asked for a trifling gift. The king said, "Your song has pleased me so well
that I will give you my daughter there - to wife." The kings daughter
shuddered, but the king said, "I have taken an oath to give you to the very
first beggar man, and I will keep it." All she could say was in vain. The
priest was brought, and she had to let herself be wedded to the fiddler on the
spot. When that was done the king said, "Now it is not proper for you, a beggar
woman, to stay any longer in my palace. You may just go away with your
husband." The beggar man led her out by the hand, and she was obliged to walk
away on foot with him. When they came to a large forest, she asked, "To whom
does that beautiful forest belong?" It belongs to King Thrushbeard. If you had
taken him, it would have been yours.  Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but
taken king Thrushbeard.  Afterwards they came to a meadow, and she asked again,
"To whom does this beautiful green meadow belong?" It belongs to King
Thrushbeard. If you had taken him, it would have been yours.  Ah, unhappy girl
that I am, if I had but taken King Thrushbeard.  Then they came to a large
town, and she asked again, "To whom does this fine, large town belong?" It
belongs to King Thrushbeard. If you had taken him, it would have been yours.
"Ah, unhappy girl that I am, if I had but taken King Thrushbeard.  It does not
please me, said the fiddler, to hear you always wishing for another husband. Am
I not good enough for you?  At last they came to a very little hut, and she
said, Oh goodness. What a small house! To whom does this miserable, tiny hovel
belong?  The fiddler answered, That is my house and yours, where we shall live
together.  She had to stoop in order to go in at the low door. Where are the
servants? Said the kings daughter.  What servants? Answered the beggar man. You
must yourself do what you wish to have done. Just make a fire at once, and set
on the water to cook my supper, I am quite tired.  But the kings daughter knew
nothing about lighting fires or cooking, and the beggar man had to lend a hand
himself to get anything fairly done. When they had finished their scanty meal
they went to bed. But he forced her to get up quite early in the morning in
order to look after the house.  For a few days they lived in this way as well
as might be, and came to the end of all their provisions. Then the man said,
"Wife, we cannot go on any longer eating and drinking here and earning nothing.
You must make baskets. He went out, cut some willows, and brought them home.
Then she began to make baskets, but the tough willows wounded her delicate
hands. I see that this will not do, said the man. You had better spin - perhaps
you can do that better.  She sat down and tried to spin, but the hard thread
soon cut her soft fingers so that the blood ran down.  See, said the man, you
are fit for no sort of work. I have made a bad bargain with you. Now I will try
to make a business with pots and earthenware. You must sit in the marketplace
and sell the wares.  Alas, thought she, if any of the people from my fathers
kingdom come to the market and see me sitting there, selling, how they will
mock me. But it was of no use, she had to yield unless she should choose to die
of hunger. For the first time she succeeded well, for the people were glad to
buy the womans wares because she was good looking, and they paid her what she
asked. Many even gave her the money and left the pots with her as well. So they
lived on what she had earned as long as it lasted, then the husband bought a
lot of new crockery. With this she sat down at the corner of the market place,
and set it out around her ready for sale. But suddenly there came a drunken
hussar galloping along, and he rode right among the pots so that they were all
broken into a thousand bits. She began to weep, and did now know what to do for
fear.  Alas, what will happen to me? Cried she. What will my husband say to
this?" She ran home and told him of the misfortune.  Who would seat herself at
a corner of the market place with crockery? Said the man. Leave off crying, I
see very well that you cannot do any ordinary work, so I have been to our kings
palace and have asked whether they cannot find a place for a kitchen maid, and
they have promised me to take you. In that way you will get your food for
nothing.  The kings daughter was now a kitchen maid, and had to be at the cooks
beck-and-call, and do the dirtiest work. In both her pockets she fastened a
little jar, in which she took home her share of the leavings, and upon this
they lived.  It happened that the wedding of the kings eldest son was to be
celebrated, so the poor woman went up and placed herself by the door of the
hall to look on. When all the candles were lit, and people, each more beautiful
than the other had entered, and all was full of pomp and splendour, she thought
of her lot with a sad heart, and cursed the pride and haughtiness which had
humbled her and brought her to so great poverty.  The smell of the delicious
dishes which were being taken in and out had reached her, and now and then the
servants threw her a few morsels of them. These she put in her jars to take
home.  All at once the kings son entered, clothed in velvet and silk, with gold
chains about his neck. When he saw the beautiful woman standing by the door he
seized her by the hand, and would have danced with her. But she refused and
shrank with fear, for she saw that it was King Thrushbeard - her suitor whom
she had driven away with scorn. Her struggles were of no avail, for he drew her
into the hall. But the string by which her pockets were hung had broken. The
pots fell down, the soup ran out, and the scraps were scattered all about.
When the people saw it, there arose general laughter and derision, and she was
so ashamed that she would rather have been a thousand fathoms below the ground.
She sprang to the door and would have run away, but on the stairs a man caught
her and brought her back. When she looked at him, it was king Thrushbeard
again.  He said to her kindly, Do not be afraid, I and the fiddler who has been
living with you in that wretched hovel are one. For love of you, I disguised
myself so. And I was also the hussar who rode through your crockery. This was
all done to humble your proud spirit, and to punish you for the insolence with
which you mocked me.  Then she wept bitterly and said, "I have done great
wrong, and am not worthy to be your wife." But he said, "Be comforted, the evil
days are past. Now we will celebrate our wedding. Then the maids-in-waiting
came in and put on her the most splendid clothing, and her father and his whole
court came and wished her happiness in her marriage with King Thrushbeard, and
the joy now began in earnest. I wish you and I had been there too.

title = Rumpelstiltskin
Author = Brothers Grim
quote = Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a beautiful daughter. Now it
happened that he had an audience with the king, and in order to make himself
appear as a person of importance he said to him, I have a daughter who can spin
straw into gold. The king said to the miller, That is an art which pleases me
well; if your daughter is as clever as you say, bring her tomorrow to my
palace, and I will try what she can do.  When the girl was brought to him he
took her into a room which was quite full of straw, gave her a spinning wheel
and a reel, and said, Now set to work, and if by tomorrow morning early you
have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die. Thereupon he
himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone. So there sat the poor
millers daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do; she had no
idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more miserable,
until at last she began to weep.  All at once the door opened, and in came a
little man, who said, Good evening, Mistress Miller; why are you crying so?
Alas! answered the girl, I have to spin this straw into gold, and I do not know
how to do it.  What will you give me, said the manikin, if I do it for you?  My
necklace, said the girl. The little man took the necklace, seated himself in
front of the wheel, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was
full; then he put another on, and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and
the second was full too. And so it went on until the morning, when all the
straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold. By daybreak the king was
already there, and when he saw the gold he was astonished and delighted, but
his heart became only more greedy. He had the millers daughter taken into
another room full of straw, which was much larger, and commanded her to spin
that also in one night, if she valued her life.  The girl knew not how to help
herself, and was crying, when the door again opened, the little man appeared
and said, What will you give me if I spin that straw into gold for you?  The
ring on my finger, answered the girl. The little man took the ring. He again
began to turn the wheel, and by morning had spun all the straw into glittering
gold.  The king rejoiced beyond measure at the sight, but still he had not gold
enough; and he had the millers daughter taken into a still larger room full of
straw, and said, You must spin this too, in the course of this night; but if
you succeed, you shall be my wife.  Even if she be a millers daughter, thought
he, I could not find a richer wife in the whole world.  When the girl was
alone, the manikin came again for the third time and said, What will you give
me if I spin the straw for you this time also?  I have nothing left that I
could give, answered the girl.  Then promise me, if you should become queen,
your first child.  Who knows whether that will ever happen? Thought the millers
daughter, and not knowing how else to help herself in this strait, she promised
the manikin what he wanted, and for that he once more span the straw into gold.
When the king came in the morning and found all as he had wished, he took her
in marriage, and the pretty millers daughter became a queen.  A year after, she
had a beautiful child, and she never gave a thought to the manikin. Suddenly he
came into her room, and said, Now give me what you promised. The queen was
horror struck, and offered the manikin all the riches of the kingdom if he
would leave her the child. But the manikin said, No, something that is living
is dearer to me than all the treasures in the world. Then the queen began to
weep and cry, so that the manikin pitied her. I will give you until three days
time, said he, and if by that time you find out my name, then shall you keep
your child.  So the queen thought the whole night of all the names that she had
ever heard, and she sent a messenger over the country to enquire, far and wide,
for any other names that there might be. When the manikin came the next day,
she began with Caspar, Melchior, Balthazar and said all the names she knew, one
after another; but to every one the little man said, That is not my name.  On
the second day she had enquiries made in the neighbourhood as to the names of
the people there, and she repeated to the manikin the most uncommon and
curious. Perhaps your name is Shortribs, or Sheepshanks, or Laceleg? But he
always answered, That is not my name.  On the third day the messenger came back
again and said, I have not been able to find a single new name, but as I came
to a high mountain at the end of the forest, where the fox and the hare bid
each other good night, there I saw a little house, and before the house a fire
was burning, and round about the fire quite a ridiculous little man was
jumping. He hopped upon one leg, and shouted; Today I bake, tomorrow brew, The
next Ill have the young queens child.  Ha! Glad am I that no one knew That
Rumpelstiltskin I am styled.  You may think how glad the queen was when she
heard the name! When soon afterwards the little man came in and asked, Now,
Mistress Queen, what is my name? At first she said, Is your name Conrad?  No.
Is your name Harry?  No.  Perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?  The devil has
told you that! The devil has told you that! Cried the little man, and in his
anger he plunged his right foot so deep into the earth that his whole leg went
in; and then in rage he pulled at his left leg so hard with both hands that he
tore himself in two.

title = Rapunzel
Author = Brothers Grimm
quote = There were once a man and a woman who had long wished for a child  but
without any luck. At last, the woman hoped that God was about to grant her
desire. They had a little window at the back of their house from which a
splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and
herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into
it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded
by all the world.  One day the woman was standing by this window and looking
down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most
beautiful plant called a rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she
longed for it; she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable. Then
her husband was alarmed, and asked, "What troubles you, dear wife?" "Ah," she
replied, "if I cant eat some of the rapunzel, which is in the garden behind our
house, I shall die." The man, who loved her, thought, "Sooner than let your
wife die, better bring her some of the rapunzel  let it cost you what it will."
When it was getting dark, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of
the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of the rapunzel plant and took it
to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It
tasted so good to her  so very good that the next day she longed for it three
times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more
descend into the garden.  In the gloom of evening therefore, he let himself
down again; but when he had clambered down the wall he was struck with terror,
for he saw the enchantress standing before him. "How can you dare," said she
with angry look, "climb down into my garden and steal my rapunzel, like a
thief? You shall suffer for it!" "Ah," answered he, "let mercy take the place
of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your
rapunzel from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have
died if she had not gotten some to eat." Then the enchantress allowed her anger
to be softened, and said to him, "If you speak the truth, I will allow you to
take away with you as much rapunzel as you will, only I make one condition, you
must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be
well treated, and I will care for it like a mother." The man in his terror
agreed to everything, and when the child was born, the enchantress appeared at
once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.  Rapunzel
grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years
old, the enchantress shut her in a tower, which lay in a forest, and had
neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the
enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel; let down your hair to me." Rapunzel had magnificent long
hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she
unfastened her braided tresses, wound them around one of the hooks of the
window above. Then the hair fell twenty yards down, and the enchantress climbed
up by it.  After a year or two, it happened that the kings son rode through the
forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming
that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed
her time in letting her sweet voice sing out. The kings son wanted to climb up
to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode
home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart that every day he went
out into the forest and listened to it.  Once when he was thus standing behind
a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,
"Rapunzel, Rapunzel; let down your hair to me." Rapunzel let down the braids of
her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. "If that is the ladder that
leads to the top, I too will try my fortune," said he, and the next day when it
began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel; let
down your hair to me." Immediately the hair fell down and the prince climbed
up; at first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had
never yet beheld, came to her; but the kings son began to talk to her quite
like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let
him have no rest - he had been forced to see her. Rapunzel lost her fear, and
when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he
was young and handsome, she thought, "He will love me more than old Dame Gothel
the enchantress does," so she said yes, and laid her hand in his.  She said, "I
will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with
you a ball of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it.
When that is ready I will climb down, and you will take me on your horse." They
agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old
woman came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once
Rapunzel said to her, "Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so
much heavier for me to draw up than the young kings son - he is with me in a
moment." "Ah! You wicked child," cried the enchantress. "What do I hear you
say? I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have
deceived me!" In her anger she clutched Rapunzels beautiful hair, wrapped it
twice around her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip
snap; they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. She was so
pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in
great grief and misery.  On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however,
the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook
of the window, and when the kings son came and cried, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel; let
down your hair to me." She let the hair down and the kings son climbed, but
instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at
him with wicked and poisonous looks.  "Aha!" She cried mockingly. "You would
fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to
you; you will never see her again." The kings son was beside himself with pain,
and in his despair he leaped down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but
the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blindly
about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but and
weep over the loss of his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some
years, and at last came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which
she had given birth; a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.  He heard a
voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he
approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears
wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as
before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they
lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.

Title = The Pursuit of Love
Author = NIDH
Quote = I have loved her for thirteen months and five days; its just that she
doesnt know about it.  She works at the corner bakery where they sell those
awesome cupcakes or so I am told, but I cant be sure of that even though I have
purchased hundreds of them. The mere sight of her sends all my senses on a
strike leaving me with a thunderous pounding of the heart that resonates loudly
in my eardrums. I am sure we have a past connection but the thought that she
will never know gnaws at my heart making me ill at ease.  But today, I feel
that something important is going to happen and all these thoughts buzzing
around in my head is making me dizzy.  But that could also be because I hadnt
had anything to eat or drink  Or maybe because I havent slept in the last forty
eight hours. It has been raining heavily since then and the torment of the
falling drops on the window pane is like a whip lashing for me as I sit by the
window, delirious, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. It has been forty eight
hours since the rain started, its the heaviest in ten years I heard the chap
say on the weather channel and its likely to continue.  And these hours have
been the toughest  not being able to see my love But wait  what is this that I
see? A light  a faint one inside the bakery  It must be her; it has to be her I
stumble down the staircase, run through the alley, crossing the road; all wet
by the rain but kept warm by the love burning inside me. I know what you are
thinking  that its such a cliché. But for some clichés are the closest to
truth.  I reach the door of the bakery; I can hardly see anything inside
through the glass. I hesitate not sure what is it that I can do, the rain is
soaking me through though I know my love cannot be washed away and she will
know, yes she will know.  And then the doors open and there she is  my love
she looks at me then smiles and says in that melodious voice of hers, sorry, we
are closed I wait for the words to come from her mouth, even mine, but theres
none  I smile in return, hiding my anguish, and I walk away slowly back in the
rain.  At the steps of the building, I pause  self ridicule makes me halt for a
mere second, and I turn to look back in the direction of my love and watch her
walk away, the umbrella barely doing a good job, her white dress now sticking
to her legs and her hair clings around her waist instead of my hands, and she
half walks and half skips to a waiting car. The door opens as she approaches it
and a man gets out, runs towards her, hugs her and then kisses her. I hear her
laugh, a playful laugh and that laugh urges me to run towards her and scream
out loud, Not him, me. I who have loved you secretly for months not him, its me
But I remain rooted to the spot and with an ever burdening heart watch her
drive away and I return to my room to bide my time till another day.

title = Old Sultan 
Author = Sultan
quote = A farmer once had a faithful dog called Sultan, who had grown old, and
lost all his teeth, so that he could no longer bite. One day the farmer was
standing with his wife before the house door, and said, Tomorrow I intend to
shoot Old Sultan, he is no longer of any use.  His wife, who felt pity for the
faithful beast, answered, He has served us so long, and been so faithful, that
we might well keep him.  Eh! What? Said the man. You are not very sharp. He has
not a tooth left in his mouth, and no thief is afraid of him; now he may be
off. If he has served us, he has had good feeding for it.  The poor dog, who
was lying stretched out in the sun not far off, had heard everything, and was
sorry that the morrow was to be his last day. He had a good friend, the wolf,
and he crept out in the evening into the forest to him, and complained of the
fate that awaited him. Listen well, said the wolf, "and dont be sad. I will
help you out of your trouble. I have thought of something. Tomorrow, early in
the morning, your master is going with his wife to make hay, and they will take
their little child with them, for no one will be left behind in the house. As
usual, during work time, they will lay the child under the hedge in the shade;
you lie there too, just as if you wished to guard it. Then I will come out of
the wood, and carry off the child. You must rush swiftly after me. I will let
it fall, and you will take it back to its parents, who will think that you have
saved it, and will be far too grateful to do you any harm - quite the opposite;
you will be dear to their hearts, and they will never let you lack for anything
again.  The plan pleased the dog, and it was carried out just as it was
arranged. The father screamed when he saw the wolf running across the field
with his child, but when Old Sultan brought it back, then he was full of joy,
and stroked him and said, Not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my
bread free as long as you live. To his wife he said, Go home at once and make
Old Sultan some soggy bread that he will not have to bite, and bring the pillow
out of my bed, I will give it to him to lie upon. From that time on, Old Sultan
was as well off as he could wish to be.  Soon afterwards the wolf visited him,
and was pleased that everything had succeeded so well. But, listen well, said
he, you will just wink an eye when I carry off one of your masters fat sheep.
Do not reckon upon that, answered the dog. I will remain true to my master; I
cannot agree to that. The wolf, who thought that this could not be spoken in
earnest, came creeping about in the night and was going to take away the sheep.
But faithful old Sultan barked, and the farmer chased after the wolf with a big
stick. The wolf had to pack off, but he cried out to the dog, Wait a bit, you
scoundrel, you shall pay for this.  The next morning the wolf sent the wild
boar to challenge the dog to come out into the forest so that they might settle
the affair. Old Sultan could find no one to stand by him but a cat with only
three legs, and as they went out together the poor cat limped along, and at the
same time stretched out her tail into the air with pain.  The wolf and his
friend were already on the spot appointed, but when they saw their enemy coming
they thought that he was bringing a sabre with him, for they mistook the
outstretched tail of the cat for one. When the poor beast hopped on its three
legs, they could only think every time that it was picking up a stone to throw
at them. So they were both afraid; the wild boar crept into the under-wood and
the wolf jumped up a tree.  The dog and the cat, when they came up, wondered
that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to
hide himself altogether; and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the
cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear. The cat, who thought
it was a mouse moving there, jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a
fearful noise and ran away, crying out, The guilty one is up in the tree! The
dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf, who was ashamed of having proved
himself to be so afraid, and made friends with the dog.

title = The Selfish Giant
Author = Oscar Wilde 
quote = It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. Here and there
over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve
peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink
and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. The birds sat on the trees and
sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen
to them. "How happy we are here!" they cried to each other.  One day the Giant
came back. He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed
with him for seven years. After the seven years were over he had said all that
he had to say, for his conversation was limited, and he determined to return to
his own castle. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.
"What are you doing here?" he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran
away.  "My own garden is my own garden," said the Giant; "any one can
understand that, and I will allow nobody to play in it but myself." So he built
a high wall all round it, and put up a notice-board.  TRESPASSERS WILL BE
PROSECUTED He was a very selfish Giant.  The poor children had now nowhere to
play. They tried to play on the road, but the road was very dusty and full of
hard stones, and they did not like it. They used to wander round the high wall
when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside. "How
happy we were there," they said to each other.  Then the Spring came, and all
over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. Only in the
garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. The birds did not care to sing
in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom. Once a
beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the
notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the
ground again, and went off to sleep. The only people who were pleased were the
Snow and the Frost. "Spring has forgotten this garden," they cried, "so we will
live here all the year round." The Snow covered up the grass with her great
white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. Then they invited the
North Wind to stay with them, and he came. He was wrapped in furs, and he
roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney-pots down.  "This is a
delightful spot," he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." So the Hail came.
Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke
most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he
could go. He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.  "I cannot
understand why the Spring is so late in coming," said the Selfish Giant, as he
sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden; "I hope there will
be a change in the weather." But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. The
Autumn gave golden fruit to every garden, but to the Giant's garden she gave
none. "He is too selfish," she said. So it was always Winter there, and the
North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the
trees.  One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely
music. It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's
musicians passing by. It was really only a little linnet singing outside his
window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it
seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world. Then the Hail
stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a
delicious perfume came to him through the open casement. "I believe the Spring
has come at last," said the Giant; and he jumped out of bed and looked out.
What did he see?  He saw a most wonderful sight. Through a little hole in the
wall the children had crept in, and they were sitting in the branches of the
trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees
were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves
with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads.
The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were
looking up through the green grass and laughing. It was a lovely scene, only in
one corner it was still winter. It was the farthest corner of the garden, and
in it was standing a little boy. He was so small that he could not reach up to
the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.
The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind
was blowing and roaring above it. "Climb up! little boy," said the Tree, and it
bent its branches down as low as it could; but the boy was too tiny.  And the
Giant's heart melted as he looked out. "How selfish I have been!" he said; "now
I know why the Spring would not come here. I will put that poor little boy on
the top of the tree, and then I will knock down the wall, and my garden shall
be the children's playground for ever and ever." He was really very sorry for
what he had done.  So he crept downstairs and opened the front door quite
softly, and went out into the garden. But when the children saw him they were
so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again. Only
the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not
see the Giant coming. And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in
his hand, and put him up into the tree. And the tree broke at once into
blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out
his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him. And the
other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came
running back, and with them came the Spring. "It is your garden now, little
children," said the Giant, and he took a great axe and knocked down the wall.
And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant
playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.  All
day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him
good-bye.  "But where is your little companion?" he said: "the boy I put into
the tree." "We don't know," answered the children; "he has gone away." "You
must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow," said the Giant. But the
children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him
before; and the Giant felt very sad.  Every afternoon, when school was over,
the children came and played with the Giant. But the little boy whom the Giant
loved was never seen again. The Giant was very kind to all the children, yet he
longed for his first little friend, and often spoke of him. "How I would like
to see him!" he used to say.  Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and
feeble. He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and
watched the children at their games, and admired his garden. "I have many
beautiful flowers," he said; "but the children are the most beautiful flowers
of all." One winter morning he looked out of his window as he was dressing. He
did not hate the Winter now, for he knew that it was merely the Spring asleep,
and that the flowers were resting.  Suddenly he rubbed his eyes in wonder, and
looked and looked. It certainly was a marvelous sight. In the farthest corner
of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms. Its branches
were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood
the little boy he had loved.  Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out
into the garden. He hastened across the grass, and came near to the child. And
when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath
dared to wound thee?" For on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of
two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet.  "Who hath
dared to wound thee?" cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword
and slay him." "Nay!" answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."
"Who art thou?" said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt
before the little child.  And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him,
"You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my
garden, which is Paradise." And when the children ran in that afternoon, they
found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.

title = The White Snake
Author = Brothers Grimm
quote = A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through
all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of the most
secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a strange custom;
every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was
present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. It was covered,
however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone
else know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was
quite alone.  This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who
took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help
carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door, he
lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But when he saw
it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut off a little
bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it touched his tongue than he
heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. He went and
listened, and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering
together, and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in
the fields and woods. Eating the snake had given him power of understanding the
language of animals.  Now, it so happened that on this very day the queen lost
her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this
trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to
be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could
before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as
guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence.  In his trouble and
fear he went down into the courtyard and thought long and hard. Now some ducks
were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and while they
were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a
confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened. They
were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about
all the morning, and what good food they had found, when one said in a pitiful
tone, Something lies heavy on my stomach. As I was eating in haste, I swallowed
a ring which lay under the queens window.  The servant at once seized her,
carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook, Here is a fine duck; roast
her for dinner.  Yes, said the cook, and weighed her in his hand, she has
spared no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long
enough. As he prepared the duck for dinner, he found the ring inside.  The
servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make amends for
the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour and promised him the best place in the
court that he could wish for. The servant refused everything, and only asked
for a horse and some money for travelling - as he had a mind to see the world
and go about a little.  When his request was granted he set out on his way. One
day he came to a pond, where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and
gasping for water. Now, though it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them
complaining that they must perish so miserably, and as he had a kind heart, he
got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They
quivered with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him, We will remember
you and repay you for saving us!  He rode on, and after a while it seemed to
him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an
ant king complain, Why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our
bodies? That stupid horse with his heavy hoofs has been treading down my people
without mercy! So he turned on to a side path and the ant king cried out to
him, We will remember you  one good turn deserves another!  The path led him
into a wood, and here he saw two old ravens standing by their nest, and
throwing out their young ones. Out with you, you idle, good-for-nothing
creatures! Cried they. "We cannot find food for you any longer; you are big
enough, and can provide for yourselves." But the poor young ravens lay upon the
ground, flapping their wings, and crying, Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We
must shift for ourselves, and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here
and starve?  So the good young fellow climbed down, and gave them his own food
which he had been carrying for his lunch. Then they came hopping up to it,
satisfied their hunger, and cried, We will remember you  one good turn deserves
another!  When he had gone on a long way further, he came to a large city.
There was a great noise and crowd in the streets, and a man rode up on
horseback, crying aloud, The kings daughter wants a husband; but whoever sues
for her hand must perform a hard task, and if he does not succeed he will
forfeit his life. Many had already made the attempt - but in vain.
Nevertheless, when the youth saw the kings daughter he was so overcome by her
great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared
himself a suitor.  So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown
into it, in his sight. Then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the
bottom of the sea, and added, If you come up again without it you will be
thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves. All the people
grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the
sea.  He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly he
saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very fishes whose
lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it
laid on the shore at the youths feet, and when he had taken it up and opened
it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. Full of joy he took it to the king,
and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.  But when the proud
princess saw that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required
him first to perform another task. She went down into the garden and strewed
with her own hands ten sacksfull of millet seed on the grass. Then she said,
"Tomorrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single
grain be wanting." The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might
be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he
sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death. But
as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten
sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing.
The ant king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and
the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet seed and
gathered them into the sacks.  Presently the kings daughter herself came down
into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she
had given him. But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said,
Although he has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he
has brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.  The youth did not know where
the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on forever, as long
as his legs would carry him - though he had no hope of finding it. After he had
wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to a wood, and lay down
under a tree to sleep. He heard a rustling in the branches, and a golden apple
fell into his hand. At the same time three ravens flew down to him, perched
themselves upon his knee, and said, We are the three young ravens whom you
saved from starving; when we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking The
Golden Apple, we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of
Life stands, and have brought you the apple.  The youth, full of joy, set out
homewards, and took The Golden Apple to the kings beautiful daughter, who had
no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it
together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in
undisturbed happiness to a great age.

quote = Once upon a time, there lived a woodcutter and his wife, who had three
sons. The eldest two were strong and tall, and their mother and father were
always telling them how handsome and clever they were  but the youngest son
was, to tell you the truth, just a bit simple in the head. He wasnt very tall,
and he wasnt very strong, and his family thought he was good for nothing. They
hardly ever called him by his real name, but instead they gave him a cruel
nickname. They called him Dummy, because they said he was stupid.  One day the
eldest son wanted to go to the forest to cut wood. The mother praised him for
being such a useful boy, and before he set out she gave him some of her best
fruit cake for his lunch, and a bottle of wine to wash it down. While the boy
was walking through the forest, he met a little grey old man who said to him:
Do give me a little piece of your cake and a swig of your wine. Im so terribly
hungry and thirsty.  And the eldest son replied: Be off with you, you filthy
old beggar.  The little grey old man went away, but not without taking his
revenge. He put a curse on the boy, so that when he started to cut a tree down,
his axe slipped and went into his leg. The boy limped home to his mother who
washed his wound and bandaged him.  The next day, the second eldest son went
out to the forest to cut wood. Before he set out, his mother praised him for
being such a useful boy, but especially asked him to be careful with the axe,
so as not to have a nasty accident like his brother. The boy promised not to be
careless, and his mother gave him some of her best sponge cake for his lunch,
and a bottle of wine to wash it down.  It happened that as the boy was walking
through the woods, he came across the same little grey old man. The man said to
him: Do please share your sponge cake and your wine with me, for I am so
terribly weak with hunger and thirst.  The boy said: Be off with you, you lazy
old scoundrel. If you want to eat, youd better work.  The little grey old man
went away, but not without taking his revenge. Not long after, when the boy was
cutting down a tree, his axe flew out of his hand and hit him on the head. He
crawled home to his mother who bandaged up his wound and asked him why he had
not kept his promise to be more careful.  For the rest of the week, the two
eldest sons were both lying in bed recovering from their wounds. The father
said to the third and youngest son: Get on your feet, you lazy Dummy. Why are
you sitting around doing nothing, when both brothers are hurt and unable to
work? Get out to the forest and cut some wood  if youre not too stupid to do
that.  The mother laughed at him and said: Its more than likely that Dummy will
cut his own head off  but it wont be much of a loss to anyone. Before he left
she gave him some cake that she had burned almost to a crust in the oven, and a
bottle of sour beer to wash it down.  As the youngest boy was going through the
woods, he met the same little grey old man who had crossed the path of his
brothers. The man said to him: Do please share some of your cake and beer with
me. I am so terribly hungry and thirsty, and I fear that if I dont have
something to eat and drink soon, I will surely die The young boy replied: Old
man, I will gladly share with you what I have  but the cake is burnt and the
beer is sour.  Never mind that, said the man. I am grateful for what you can
give me.  The boy and the little grey old man sat down and shared the cake and
the beer. After they had finished their lunch, the man said: Since you have a
good heart, and have shared what you have with me, I will give you a reward.
You see that old tree over there. Cut it down with your axe and you will find
something of value inside its hollow trunk.  So when the little grey old man
had left, the young boy, whose parents called him Dummy, took his axe and cut
down the hollow tree just as he had been told. Inside he found a goose  but
this was no ordinary bird, for its feathers were made of gold.  The boy
realised that he was in luck, and thought to himself: Why should I go home now
and suffer the insults of my parents and brothers? They will take this valuable
bird from me, and I shall have nothing. So the boy decided to run away from
home. He put the golden goose under his arm and set out for the town. Then he
went to the inn, intending to stay there. He stood at the bar and asked the
innkeeper if he would accept a golden feather as payment for his board and
lodgings. When the innkeeper saw the golden goose, he readily agreed.  After
the boy had gone to bed he said to his three daughters: That young boy whose
parents call Dummy is staying up in our guest room. But he cant be as simple in
the head as they say  for hes got a valuable bird with him  a goose with
feathers made of gold.  The eldest daughter thought to herself: Well fancy
that; feathers made of gold. Ill pluck one or maybe more of those for myself.
After the clock struck midnight, she sneaked into the boys room, and saw that
he was asleep with his arm around the golden goose. She crept up and tried to
pluck a feather, but the feather wouldnt budge, and when she tried to take her
hand away, she found that she was stuck to it. She couldnt move, and she
couldnt cry out for fear of waking the boy. She had to stay where she was  on
her knees by the bed, with her hand on the feather.  After the clock struck one
in the morning, the second sister came in the room, planning to take one
feather or more for herself. In the dark she didnt see her sister, but as soon
as she touched her back, she found that her hand was stuck fast to her, and she
had to stay where she was, not moving and not making a sound.  After the clock
struck two in the morning, the third sister came in. The other two shouted:
Stay back! But it was too late  she reached out hoping to steal a feather and
found that her hand was stuck to the middle sister.  The boy and the goose
slept soundly through all of this. In the morning the boy got up, paid his bill
with a golden feather, and left the inn with the goose under his arm. The
sisters had no choice but to follow on behind him. What a pretty procession
they made!  Along the way they met the bishop: What a sight! He exclaimed. Its
hardly right for three young women to follow a boy around like that!  As the
girls went past he tapped the youngest on the shoulder. In doing so he found
that he was stuck to her and had to follow.  Further up the road they met a
police sergeant. The bishop called out to him: Sergeant. Help me get free from
this young womans shoulder. Im stuck to her and people are bound to start all
kinds of gossip about it!  The police sergeant tried to pull the bishop free,
but in doing so he found that both his hands were stuck to his waist, and he
had to follow along with the procession.  At the top of the road they met the
mayor. Whats this town coming to? Cried the mayor. The bishop and the police
sergeant are following three young girls who are following a young boy; all
holding on to each other in a most unseemly fashion. Have they gone mad?  As he
spoke, he tried to pull the police sergeant and the bishop away  but in doing
so he found that he was stuck to both of them, and had to follow on.  The boy
led the little line of the townspeople along up the road, and at the top of the
hill they passed the Kings palace. Now the Kings daughter was very beautiful,
but she had the saddest face in the whole wide world. She had never laughed and
not once even smiled. The King was so troubled by the young princess
unhappiness, that he had made a special law: Whosoever could make her laugh and
smile would win her hand in marriage.  But the truth was that nothing very
funny ever happened inside the royal palace. All the Kings servants and
advisers were far too high and mighty to understand what would make a young
girl laugh  or indeed to allow anything amusing to happen at all.  As the boy,
known as Dummy, went past the palace, he still held the golden goose under his
arm; and he was followed by the innkeepers three daughters, the bishop, the
police sergeant, and the mayor. The princess looked out and saw the important
people in their uniforms being tugged along behind three girls and a boy with a
goose. She thought that it was the first thing she had seen in her life that
was truly funny. She burst out laughing and ran, still giggling, to her father
to tell him all about what she had seen. When the King looked out of his window
and saw the procession, he couldnt help laughing himself. He sent for his
guards and told them to bring the boy and his followers directly to him. When
the boy entered the Kings chamber, with the followers behind him; the mayor,
the bishop and the policeman all called out angrily that he should pay for his
crime with his head. The king, still laughing, said that on the contrary  he
would be rewarded with the hand in marriage of his daughter, the princess.  For
an entire week after that, the innkeepers three daughters, the bishop, the
policeman, and the mayor were all stuck to the golden goose and to one another.
While they were stuck, all the townspeople and the whole court laughed and
laughed at them. The boy whose family called him Dummy married the princess and
inherited the kingdom. He lived with his beautiful wife and they had six happy
smiling children, and the palace was often filled with laughter.

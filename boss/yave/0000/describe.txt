        RepbaView - Viewing Graphic Novels 
    </div>
  
    <div class="content" style="font-size:medium">

        A wide range of comics and short stories are available in graphic novel
        format where pages include graphics and related text. RepbaView is
        designed to effectively view the novels.  Click <a
        href=https://repba.com?YAWQ>here</a> to see the above graphic novel in
        full screen.</a> <p><p>

        Thousands of graphic novel comics and short stories have been created over
        the years in .jpg format. They are best suited for viewing on wide screen
        PCs, tablets where the full width of a page can be displayed on the screen.
        Since their page height is greater than the vertical PC and tablet screen
        height, down paging is required to properly view a novel.  Common sizes for
        graphic novels are “5.5 x 8.5” or “8.5 x 11”. Due to printing requirements,
        the total pages of a comic book are divisible by 4. Repbaview supports
        viewing graphic novels by both wide and smaller width devices.  Smaller
        width devices such as cell phones involve more navigation steps where a
        user must move across the page in addition to moving down.  RepbaView
        provides an imagegroup menu for users to select specific graphic novels. A
        thumbnail menu is provided to view individual pages of a novel. <p><p> 

        Steps to view a graphic novel on a wide screen PC or tablet.<br>
        1. An iFrame could be used to 
           display a specific graphic novel but the limited screen size would be a disadvantage.<br>
        2. Click the upper left image menu icon to enable a graphic display of the imagegroup graphic novels. <br>
        3. Pan thru the images and select the "Punisher Black Widow" comic book.<br>
        4. Click the top display row to enable the zoom icons and click the "+" icon until the vertical red line is just outside
           the horizontal screen ends.<br>
        5. Click the down/up arrow or pgdn/pgup to move down/up the image in vertical rotation increments to move down the image 
           and read the 54 page comic book. New pages are always displayed at the top of page.<p><p>
        Notes:<br>
        -- Tap the footer +/- to move to the next or previous page.<br>
        -- Click the upper left menu to select a new graphic novel.<br>
        -- Small width devices require panning to view the covered portion of the page before moving down.<br>

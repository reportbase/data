	A wide range of comics and short stories are available in graphic novel format where pages include 
        graphics and related text. RepbaView is desinged to effectively view graphic novels. .</a> <p><p>
	
        Thousands of graphic novel comics and short stories have been created over the years in .jpg format. They are best suited 
        for viewing on wide screen PCs, tablets where the full width of a page can be displayed on a page. Since their page height
        is greater than the vertical PC and tablet screen height, down paging is required to properly view a
        novel.  Common sizes for graphic novels are “5.5 x 8.5” 
        or “8.5 x 11”. Due to printing requirements, the total pages of a comic book are divisible by 4. Repaview supports viewing
        graphic novels for both wide and smaller width devices.  Smaller width 
        devices such as cell phones involve more navigation steps to view a graphic novel. Instead of
        down only panning motion, the user much move across the page in addition to moving down. RepbaView provides graphic menus 
        to select specific graphic novels and view each of the graphic novel pages using a Thumbnail menu. <p><p>

        Browsers do not properly display VR projection 360&deg; images. Special
        software is needed to view projection panorama images.  The cylindrical
        image processing design of RepbaView enables it to display popular VR
        projection 360&deg; images without using special headsets.  It supports
        viewing equirectangular, cylindrical, and rectilinear VR projection
        images.  Since it connects the ends of the image, it can display a wide
        range of projection 360&deg; image sizes providing a wrap around
        panning view of various image aspect ratios. For example a 2:1 image
        can zoomed to viewable 4:1 or 8:1 image. 
        Click <a href="https://repba.com?p=boss/dash"> here</a> to view example
        VR images in the Dash imagegroup.

        The dash imagegroup has 24 subgroups each with an example VR projection
        360&deg; image. Each of the subgroups can be viewed as a panorama or
        slideshow.  The panorama view is a slow and steady rotation of the VR
        image.  VR Projection 360&deg; panorama subgroups can be included in an
        imagegroup with other subgroup images and documents.  RepbaView
        displays VR projection 360&deg; images that include a front & back
        image.  The visual footer provides a browser distorted view of the
        front & back images and shows how the full zoomed image relates to the
        overall VR image.  Standard RepbaView zooming and image rotation are
        supported for VR images.  Zooming is particularly important for
        projection 360&deg images to obtain a quality user view.  Screen
        rotation and magnification steps may be needed to properly display
        specific portions of the image.  Reference the command menu help button
        for detailed command and screen interaction information. Panning keeps
        the active left & right images of the panorama displayed without moving
        to the next image.  <p>

        A browser does not properly display projection 360&deg; images. Special software is needed to view
        projection panorama images.  RepbaView is designed to view these images. 
        
        The tree imagegroup has 9 subgroups each         
        with 12 example projection 360&deg; images. Each of the subgroups can be viewed as 
        a panorama or slideshow.  Projection 360&deg; panorama subgroups can be included in an imagegroup with other 
        subgroup images and documents. 
        There are two key zooming selections: rotation and magnification. Zooming is
        particularly important for projection 360&deg images to obtain a quality user view. 
        Screen rotation and magnification steps are 
        likely needed to properly display specific portions of the image. Reference the command menu help button for
        detailed command and screen interaction information. Panning keeps the active left & right images of the panorama 
        displayed without moving to the next image.  The right or left arrows
        move to the next projection 360&deg; image in the subgroup. RepaView allows viewing projection 360&deg; panoramas without using
        special headsets.
        to activate the tree imagegroup explained herein and perform the 
        following steps to view and rotate the images.<p>

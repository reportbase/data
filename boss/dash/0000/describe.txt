        Browsers do not properly display VR projection 360&deg; images. Special software is needed to view
        projection panorama images.  The cylindrical image processing design of RepbaView enables it to display popular 
        VR projection 360&deg; images without using special headsets.  It supports viewing equirectangular, cylindrical, and 
        rectilinear VR projection images.  Since it connects the ends of the image, it can
        display a wide range of projection 360&deg; image sizes providing a wrap around panning view of various image 
        aspect ratios. For example a 2:1 image can zoomed to viewable 
        4:1 or 8:1 image.

        The dash imagegroup has 24 subgroups each         
        with an example VR projection 360&deg; image. Each of the subgroups can be viewed as 
        a panorama or slideshow.  The panorama view is a slow and steady rotation of the VR image. 
        VR Projection 360&deg; panorama subgroups can be included in an imagegroup with other 
        subgroup images and documents. RepbaView displays VR projection 360&deg; images that include a front & back image. 
        The visual footer provides a browser distorted view of the front & back images and shows how the 
        full zoomed image relates to the overall VR image.
        Standard RepbaView zooming and image rotation are supported for VR images.  Zooming is
        particularly important for projection 360&deg images to obtain a quality user view. 
        Screen rotation and magnification steps may be needed to properly display specific portions of the image. 
        Reference the command menu help button for
        detailed command and screen interaction information. Panning keeps the active left & right images of the panorama 
        displayed without moving to the next image.  <p>

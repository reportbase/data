        FSPIV creates panoramas from montages of images.
        FSPIV divides the panorama into slices and draws only those slices that are 
        visible.
        Very large panoramas can therefore be drawn to the screen with a quality comparable to video.
        A cylinder of the image is created in virtual memory with the viewer situated in the center. 
        The cylinder is then rotated around the viewer, providing a 360 degree panoramic experience.
        To start the cylinder's rotation, swipe the panorama from left/right or up/down.
        To rotate the cylinder short distances, quick press the image.

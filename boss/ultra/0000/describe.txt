            HTML5 renders web pages in portrait, 
            which forces digital media to be resized
            to the screen's width.   On wide landscape screens, HTML5's limitations
            have not been an issue.  
            
            However, Hand-held portrait screens are now popular, but HTML5 still has not been updated.
            HMTL5 sill requires you to scroll landscape media in portrait.  

            RepbaView fixes this situation by letting you scroll landscape digtial media in 
            portrait.

            RepbaView creates an optimal viewing experience because the images are resizes to the screen 
            height and not the screen width.<br><p>

            At the top level, RepbaView Image collections are defined as imagegroups.
            Each imagegroup consists of subgroups of image montages having similar image
            aspect ratio and size.  Dividing images appropriately between subgroups
            promotes effective image organization. Depending on the
            horizontal size of the images, montages consist of various image numbers. RepbaView
            displays images at full screen height eliminating the effort to
            pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Montages are stored in client memory as a 
            cylindrical representation. The cylinder can be rotated
            360 degrees in either direction to display panorama or slideshow images. Image
            group start-up speed and motion options of panorama, slideshow, or no-motion can be
            established. When active, an imagegroup motion and speed can be dynamically changed by the user. 
            RepbaView menus provide convenient user
            selection of image subgroups, documents, or commands. Image subgroups typically
            represent images but can also refer to nested subgroup menus.  <p><p>The display
            of RepbaView imagegroups are initiated by urls, short-urls, GIFs, or iFrames.
            These start-up options include properties that define initial motion type and
            specific subgroup to display. Available short-url names for subgroups are
            reported when selecting the "report" subgroup name of an imagegroup. They are
            particularly useful in social media posts when full url syntax is not
            supported.  When activating an imagegroup without a defined url subgroup, an
            image menu is displayed for user selection of the initial subgroup. The above
            image is an iFrame instance of a RepbaView subgroup. It can be migrated to a
            full screen view by clicking the “New Window” link below the iFrame. iFrames
            are helpful when imagegroup image displays and html text are needed on the same
            page or when images are desired in a fixed web page window space. Switching a
            RepbaView iFrame to an optional full screen new window enhances view and
            control of images.<p><p>

            Image view tuning involves changing zoom settings using the header and
            vertical image rotation using panning.  Vertical panning rotates the image up/down and the
            top header +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. The above Ultra
            imagegroup, Gallery II subgroup, iFrame view can be used to demonstrate the
            tuning options. If using a cellphone, switch to landscape view to better see
            the iFrame image. To demonstrate zooming, stop image motion by clicking
            anywhere on the screen. Then Click the top display row to enable the header which
            consists of the "- num1.num2 +" controls.  Num1 is the current zoom selection and
            the num2 is the total number of zoomable positions. Click - and + selections
            and see the num1 current zoom number to change.  To clear the header, clear the right or
            left side of the screen or enable the footer. To demonstrate vertical image rotation, 
            Pan the image up and down and watch the image rotate vertically.  <p>

            The footer that consists of the "- num1.num2 +" controls is enabled when 
            motion is stopped or the bottom display row is clicked.  Num1 is the 
            current subgroup image number and num2 is the total number of images. Click the 
            footer - and + icons to move to the next or previous image and watch the num1 value change.  
            To clear the header, clear the right or left side of the screen or enable the header. The 
            header and footer are never displayed at the same time. <p>
    
            Next select the “new window” link below the iFrame to enable full
            screen view.  While selecting various image subgroups using the top left image
            menu, perform the above zoom and image rotation image tuning steps. Click center of screen 
            to enable the thumbnail menu that allows
            users to view and select subgroup images based on their thumbnail image.  Using
            the thumbnail menu, display various images. Select an image or double click a display to
            disable the thumbnail menu. Click the browser back arrow or select url repba.com to return.  <p>
            
            An exercise to become familiar with the interactive zoom and
            vertical rotation features is to activate the “Finding Waldo” large
            high-res image and locate one or more of the 3 Waldo figures. Click <a
            href=/?p=boss/repba&k=0034&a=1&z=7 target=_parent> Waldo</a>  
            to display the image. Click the browser back arrow or select repba.com to return.<p>

            
            The "scapes" imagegroup is organized into 24 sub-groups each consisting of
            72 images. Using the image menu, click several of the image subgroups to view
            some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "scapes'' to
            display iFrame images for each subgroup. To perform these actions, tap the
            following animated GIF to enable the landscape imagegroup menu. Click the browser back arrow 
            or select url repba.com to return.<p>

            At the top level, RepbaView Image collections are defined as imagegroups.
            Each imagegroup consists of subgroups of image montages that have similar image
            aspect ratio and size.  Dividing images appropriately between subgroups
            promotes effective image organization and user access. Depending on the
            horizontal size of the images, montages consist of 1 to 18 images. RepbaView
            displays images at full screen height eliminating user time and effort to
            pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are stored in a cylinder
            format on the client with no gaps between images. The cylinder can be rotated
            360 degrees in either direction to display panorama or slideshow images. Image
            group start-up motion options of panorama, slideshow, or no motion can be
            established where motion speed can be changed by the user. The cylindrical
            image design is used to implement RepbaView menus that provide convenient user
            selection of image subgroups, documents, or commands. Image subgroups typically
            represent images but can also refer to nested subgroup menus.  <p><p>The display
            of RepbaView imagegroups are initiated by urls, short-urls, GIFs, or iFrames.
            These start-up options include properties that define initial motion type and
            specific subgroup to display. Available short-url names for subgroups are
            reported when selecting the "report" subgroup name of an imagegroup. They are
            particularly useful in social media posts when full url syntax is not
            supported.  When activating an imagegroup without a defined url subgroup, an
            image menu is displayed for user selection of the initial subgroup. The above
            image is an iFrame instance of a RepbaView subgroup. It can be migrated to a
            full screen view by clicking the “New Window” link below the iFrame. iFrames
            are helpful when imagegroup image displays and html text are needed on the same
            page or when images are desired in a fixed web page window space. Switching a
            RepbaView iFrame to an optional full screen new window enhances view and
            control of images.<p><p>

            The top header zoom icons and vertical image panning rotation provide
            interactive image view tuning.  The Image tuning process involves zooming and
            vertical image rotation.  Vertically panning rotates the image up/down and the
            top header +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. The above Ultra
            imagegroup, Gallery II subgroup iFrame view can be used to demonstrate the
            tuning options. If using a cellphone, switch to landscape view to better see
            the iFrame image. To demonstrate zooming, stop image motion by clicking
            anywhere on the screen, click the top display row to enable the header that
            consists of -, num1.num2, + icons.  The num1 is the current zoom selection and
            the num2 is the total number of zoomable positions. Click - and + selections
            and see the numbers changes.  To demonstrate vertical image rotation, click the
            bottom row to enable the footer that consists of  -, num1.num2, + icons. The
            num1 is the current subgroup image and num2 is the current rotatable position.
            Pan the image up and down and watch the image rotate with corresponding changes
            to the footer num1 value.  Click the footer - and + icons to move to the next
            or previous images. Click the browser back arrow to return to this page.<p>
            
            Next select the “new window” link below the iFrame display to enable full
            screen view.  While selecting various image subgroups using the top left image
            menu, perform the above zoom and image rotation image tuning steps. Click on
            the footer num.num icon to enable or disable the thumbnail menu that enables
            users to view and select subgroup images based on their thumbnail image.  Using
            the thumbnail menu, display various images and tap the footer num.num to
            disable the thumbnail menu. Click the browser back arrow to return to this
            page.  <p>
            
            Another exercise to become familiar with the interactive zoom and
            vertical rotation tuning features is to activate the “Finding Waldo” large
            high-res image and locate one or more of the 3 Waldo figures. Click &lt;a
            target=ifr href="/?p=boss/repo&k=0034&d=0&z=0&c=0&r=0&a=1”&gt;Waldo&lt;/a&gt;
            to display the image. Click the browser back arrow to return to this page.<p>
            
            The "scapes" imagegroup is organized into 24 sub-groups each consisting of
            72 images. Using the image menu, click several of the image subgroups to view
            some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "scapes'' to
            display iFrame images for each subgroup. To perform these actions, tap the
            following animated GIF to enable the landscape imagegroup menu. Click on the
            browser back arrow to return to this page.<p>

            RepbaView supports hi-res images.   Click <a target=ifr
            href="/?p=boss/golfer/0002&k=0001&a=2&s=2&f=1&z=1&r=2">here</a> to
            display a RepabView 30Kx10K hi-res image.  Zoom to maximum zoom level
            and see the people by the boat. The clear zooming image of hi-res
            images is provided by slicing the image into slices and only rendering
            the visible slices. Click the browser back arrow to return to this

            repba.com url to return to the home page and perform step-4 of
            the RepbaView To add the RepbaView imagegroup express iFrame view
            to any website,  insert this html directive:  &lt;iframe
            width=100% src=https://repba.com/?p=boss/express&k=0000&gt; <p>
            RepbaView supports a rich URL that can position an image at the
            desired zoom level. For example, this link will load page 66.6 of
            a graphic novel at 75% zoom where c=zoom level, and r=rotation
            level. 
            https://repba.com/?p=boss/yave&k=0058&d=10&z=11&c=5&r=5&a=0 <p>
            This link will load the middle 20% of panoramic cityscape at 50%
            zoom.
            https://repba.com/?p=boss/base&k=0011&d=0&z=11&c=5&r=5&a=1. Enter
            the browser familiarization steps.  Another exercise to become
            familiar with the interactive zoom and vertical rotation tuning
            features is to

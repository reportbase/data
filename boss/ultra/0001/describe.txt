            At the top level, RepbaView Image collections are defined as imagegroups.
            Each imagegroup consists of subgroups of image montages having similar image
            aspect ratio and size.  Dividing images appropriately between subgroups
            promotes effective image organization. Depending on the
            horizontal size of the images, montages consist of various image numbers. RepbaView
            displays images at full screen height eliminating the effort to
            pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Montages are stored in client memory as a 
            cylinder. The cylinder can be rotated
            360 degrees in either direction to display panorama or slideshow images. Image
            group start-up speed and motion options of panorama, slideshow, or no-motion can be
            established. When active, an imagegroup motion and speed can be dynamically changed by the user. 
            RepbaView menus provide convenient user
            selection of image subgroups, documents, or commands. Image subgroups typically
            represent images but can also refer to nested subgroup menus.  <p><p>The display
            of RepbaView imagegroups are initiated by urls, short-urls, GIFs, or iFrames.
            These start-up options include properties that define initial motion type and
            specific subgroup to display. Available short-url names for subgroups are
            reported when selecting the "report" subgroup name of an imagegroup. They are
            particularly useful in social media posts when full url syntax is not
            supported.  When activating an imagegroup without a defined url subgroup, an
            image menu is displayed for user selection of the initial subgroup. The above
            image is an iFrame instance of a RepbaView subgroup. It can be migrated to a
            full screen view by clicking the “New Window” link below the iFrame. iFrames
            are helpful when imagegroup image displays and html text are needed on the same
            page or when images are desired in a fixed web page window space. Switching a
            RepbaView iFrame to an optional full screen new window enhances view and
            control of images. RepbaView's advanced touch based interace allows
            easy panning of wide images that are larger than the screen.
            Touch the screen and pan the image in all directions Wide image panorams are 
            resized to the screen height and panned horizontally. Start a panoramic 
            slideshow with a quick horizontal swipe.

            Image view tuning involves changing the zoom settings using the header.
            Vertical panning moves the image up/down relative to its anchor point.
            Use the above iFrame to practice the tuning options. If using a cellphone, switch to landscape view to better see
            the iFrame image. To demonstrate zooming, stop the image motion by clicking
            anywhere on the screen. Then Click the top display row to enable the zoom header.
            Click the -/+ buttons to zoom in or out.
            To close the zoom header, click the right or
            left side of the screen.  
            Pan the image up and down to reposition the image at different anchor points.  <p>

            The footer consists -/+ controls to move the current page. The current page number is located in the center.
            To clear the footer, click the right or left side of the screen. The 
            header and footer are never displayed at the same time. <p>
    
            Next select the “new window” link below the iFrame to enable full
            screen view.  While selecting various image subgroups using the top left image
            menu, perform the above zoom and image rotation image tuning steps. Click the screen 
            to enable the footer.  Click the gear icon to show the the thumnail images.
            Select an image or double click the display to
            close the thumbnail menu. Click the browser back arrow or select url repba.com to return.  <p>
            
            An exercise to become familiar with the interactive zoom and
            vertical rotation features is to activate the “Finding Waldo” large
            high-res image and locate one or more of the 3 Waldo figures. Click <a
            href=https://repba.com?KKWN target=_parent> Waldo</a>  
            to display the image. Click the browser back arrow or select repba.com to return.<p>
            
            The "scapes" imagegroup is organized into 24 sub-groups each consisting of
            72 images. Using the image menu, click several of the image subgroups to view
            some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "scapes'' to
            display iFrame images for each subgroup. To perform these actions, tap the
            following animated GIF to enable the landscape imagegroup menu. Click the browser back arrow 
            or select url repba.com to return.<p>

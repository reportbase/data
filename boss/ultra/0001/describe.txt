        RepbaView displays pictures at full screen height eliminating the time
        for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format with no gaps between images.
        The cylindrical menus enable users to conveniently select documents,
        named picture subgroups, or commands.  <p><p>

        The objecive is to demonstrate how panning options enable users to view the hidden portion of wide landscape
        images.  When the full height iframe imaga is active, click right side of screen several times to 
        advance images. When image is stopped, notice that the image is wider than the screen. Two ways to
        see the full image are 1) depress the cursor on the right or left side to see the full 
        image, or 2) pan up or down to see the full image.  The center column of the screen is reserved for interactive image rotation and 
        zooming.  The arrows rotate the image up/down and the +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. 
        Rotate and magnify the image to become familar with these screen controls. Click right side of screen 
        to move to the center of the 
        next image. Rotate the panorama's relative position by tapping the bottom of the screen. To move the iFrame image
        to full height and initiate the actions, click on the above iframe images to stop motion and click on the bottom right full screen icon to
        activate the Ultra landscape imagegroup.<p>
        Full screen operation 
        is dependent on the type of user client. For Windows-10, select browser full screen option for complete RepbaView full screen operation.
        For Android, select RepbaView full screen option for full screen usage without image or command menus.  
        RepbaView full screen mode is not supported for IOS devices.

        When activating an image without a defined url subgroup, an image menu is displayed for user selection. This test image
        group is organized into 24 sub-groups each having 72 images. Using the image menu, click on several of the galleries to view
        some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "landscapes" to display 
        the imagegroup index that displays iFrame images for each subgroup. To peform these actions, tap the animated GIF to display the landscape 
        photography imagegroup menu. Click the browser back arrow or enter the repba.com url to return to the home page. <p>

        RepbaView displays pictures at full screen height eliminating the time
        for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format with no gaps between images.
        The cylindrical menus enable users to conveniently select documents,
        image subgroups, or commands.  <p><p>

        The objectives of this paragraph are to demonstrate how panning options enable users to view the hidden portion of wide 
        images and show how the center screen icons are used for image up/down rotation and magnification. When the full height iframe image is active, click right side of screen several times to 
        advance images. When image is stopped, notice that the image is wider than the screen. There are two ways to
        rotate the image and view its non visible ends, 1) depress the cursor on the right or left side, or 2) pan up/down. The center column of the screen is reserved for interactive image rotation and 
        zooming.  The arrows rotate the image up/down and the +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. 
        Rotate and magnify the image to become familar with these screen controls. Click right side of screen 
        to move to the center of the 
        next image. Select an image relative position by tapping the bottom of the screen. To perform these steps using a few image subgroups
        click on top iFrame image to stop motion and click the bottom right full screen icon to activate the Ultra imagegroup at full height.
        Click on the browser back arrow to return to this page. 
        <p>
        Full screen operation 
        is dependent on the type of user client. For Windows-10, select browser full screen option for continous RepbaView full screen operation.
        For Android, select RepbaView full screen option for full screen usage without image or command menus.  
        RepbaView full screen mode is not supported for IOS devices.
        <p>

        When activating an image without a defined url subgroup, an image menu is displayed for user selection. The "scapes" image
        group is organized into 24 sub-groups each having 72 images. Using the image menu, click on several of the galleries to view
        some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "landscapes" to display 
        the imagegroup index that displays iFrame images for each subgroup. To peform these actions, tap the following animated GIF to display the landscape 
        photography imagegroup menu. Enter the repba.com url to return to the home page and perform step-4 of the RepbaView familization steps.<p>

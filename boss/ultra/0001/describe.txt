        RepbaView displays pictures at full screen height eliminating the time
        for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format with no gaps between images.
        The cylindrical menus enable users to conveniently select documents,
        named picture subgroups, or commands.  As opposed to typical websites
        that stack pictures vertically, pictures are displayed horizontally,
        providing attractive continuous wrap around image viewing.<p><p>

        To demonstrate how panning options enable users to view the hidden portion of wide landscape
        images, click on the above iframe images and enable the full screen icon to
        enable the Ultra landscape imagegroup. Click right side of screen several times to 
        advance images. When image is stopped, notice that the image is wider than the screen. Two ways to
        see the full image are 1) depress the cursor on the right or left side to see the full 
        image, or 2) pan left or right to see the full image. If not using an IOS device, select
        the fullscreen icon to view the images in full screen and repeat steps to view the full
        image width.  The center column of the screen is reserved for interactive image rotation and 
        zooming.  The arrows rotate the image up/down and the +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. 
        Rotate and magnify the image to become familar with these screen controls. Click right side of screen 
        to move to the center of the 
        next image. Click back arrow to return to the home page. <p>

        Rotate the panorama's relative position by tapping the bottom of the screen.<p>

        Tap the animated GIF to display an image group of landscape photography.  The image
        group is organized into 24 sub-groups. A menu is displayed if a sub-group is not specified
        in the URL specification.<p>

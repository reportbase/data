	At the top level, RepbaView Images are defined as imagegroups. Each imagegroup
	consists of subgroups of image montages that have similar image aspect
 	ratio and size. Depending on the horizontal size of the images, montages 
	have 1 to 18 images. RepbaView displays images at full screen height eliminating time
        and effort for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format on the client with no gaps between images.
        The cylinder is rotated 360
        degrees in either direction to display panorama or slideshow images.   
        Image panorama or slideshow auto motion can be enabled as default or
        select-able speeds. The cylindrical image design is used to implement RepbaView menus that
        provide convenient user selection of image subgroups, documents, or commands.
	Subgroups typically represent images but can also refer to nested subgroup menus.
  	Manual screen gestures provide panning, movement of
        images, start auto motion, and stop auto motion.  User screen controls also
        allow users to view the hidden portions of wide images by cursor
        press or panning when it extends beyond the horizontal ends of
        the screen. A no-auto-motion command menu option is available
        to avoid inadvertent auto rotation during manual interaction steps
	and enable the right/left arrows to manually move forward/reverse individual 
        images.<p><p>
	RepbaView starts imagegroups using urls, short-urls,
        GIFs, or iFrames. These start-up options include properties that define initial motion
        and display subgroup. Available short-url names for an image group are reported when selecting the "report" subgroup name of an imagegroup. 
	They are particularly useful in social media posts when formal urls are not supported. When activating an imagegroup without a defined url subgroup, an image menu is displayed
	for user selection of the image subgroup. The image at the top of this page is an iFrame instance of a RepbaView imagegroup. It
	can be migrated to a full screen view by pinching the screen or depressing the cursor on the center 1/3rd column of the screen. iFrames are
	helpful when imagegroup displays and text are desired on the same page or when images are desired in a fixed web page window space.  
        
          

        
        <p>
        Full screen operation depends on the client type as follows.
	For Windows-10, RepbaView full screen operation is supported by the Edge browser. Select browser full screen option
        for continuous full screen operation while using RepaView.
        For Android Clients, RepbaView full screen operation is supported while viewing images of a image subgroup.  To enable another
        image or command menu, RepbaView full screen mode must be deactivated.
	For IOS clients, RepbaView full screen mode is not supported.

	The "scapes" image
        group is organized into 24 sub-groups each having 72 images. Using the image menu, click on several of the galleries to view
        some of the more than 2000 images. Click on the image menu button "landscapes" to display 
        the imagegroup index that displays iFrame images for each subgroup. To peform the above actions, tap the following animated GIF to enable the landscape 
        imagegroup menu. Enter the browser repba.com url to return to the home page and perform step-4 of the RepbaView familization steps.<p>

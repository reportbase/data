            At the top level, RepbaView Image collections are defined as
            imagegroups.  Each imagegroup consists of subgroups of image
            montages having similar image aspect ratios.  Dividing
            images between subgroups promotes effective image
            organization. Depending on the horizontal size of the images,
            montages consist of various image counts. RepbaView displays
            images at full screen height eliminating the need to
            pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Montages are stored in
            client memory as a cylinder. The cylinder can be rotated 360
            degrees in either direction to display panorama or slideshow
            images. Image group start-up speed and motion options of panorama,
            slideshow, or no-motion are availabe. When active, an
            imagegroup motion and speed can be dynamically changed by the
            user. RepbaView menus provide convenient user selection of image
            subgroups, documents, or commands. Image subgroups typically
            represent images but can also refer to nested subgroup menus.

            The displays of RepbaView imagegroups are initiated by urls,
            short-urls, GIFs, or iFrames.  These start-up options include
            properties that define initial motion type and specific subgroup to
            display. Available short-url names for subgroups are reported with
            the visual subgroup dispays of the imagegroup menu. They are
            particularly useful in social media posts when full url syntax is
            not supported.  When activating an imagegroup without a defined url
            subgroup, a visual image menu is displayed for user selection of
            the initial subgroup. The above image is an iFrame instance of a
            RepbaView subgroup.  iFrames are helpful when imagegroup image
            displays and html text are needed on the same page or when images
            are desired in a fixed web page window space. Switching a RepbaView
            iFrame to an optional full screen new window enhances view and
            control of images. RepbaView's advanced touch based interace allows
            easy panning of wide images that are larger than the screen.  Touch
            the screen and pan the image in all directions. Wide image panorams
            are resized to the screen height and panned horizontally. Start a
            panoramic slideshow with a quick horizontal swipe.  Click <a

            new window.</a> 

            <p><p>
            Full screen operation depends on the client type as follows.  For
            Windows-10, RepbaView full screen operation is supported by the
            Edge browser. Select browser full screen option for continuous full
            screen operation while using RepaView.  For Android Clients,
            RepbaView full screen operation is supported while viewing images
            of a image subgroup.  To enable another image or command menu,
            RepbaView full screen mode must be deactivated.  For IOS clients,
            RepbaView full screen mode is not supported.<p>

            Image view tuning involves changing the zoom settings using the
            header and vertical panning. Vertical panning moves the image
            up/down relative to its anchor point.  Use the above iFrame to
            practice the tuning options. If using a cellphone, switch to
            landscape view to better see the iFrame image. To demonstrate
            zooming, stop the image motion by clicking anywhere on the screen.
            Then Click the top display row to enable the zoom header.  Click
            the -/+ buttons to zoom in or out.  To close the zoom header, click
            middle of the screen.  Pan the image up and down to reposition the
            image at different anchor points.  <p>

            An exercise to become familiar with the interactive zoom and
            vertical movement features is to activate the “Finding Waldo” large
            high-res image and locate one or more of the 3 Waldo figures. Click
            <a href=https://repba.com?KKWN target=_parent> Waldo</a>  to
            display the image. Click the browser back arrow or select repba.com
            to return.<p>
            
            The "scapes" imagegroup is organized into 24 sub-groups each
            consisting of 72 images. Using the image menu, click several of the
            image subgroups to view some of the more than 2000 images. 
            Tap the animated GIF below to load the group.<p>

        RepbaView displays pictures at full screen height eliminating the time
        for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format enabling wrap around parametric viewing.
        The cylindrical menus enable users to conveniently select documents,
        named picture subgroups, or commands.  As opposed to typical websites
        that stack pictures vertically, pictures are displayed horizontally,
        providing attractive continuous wrap around image viewing.<br> <p>

        Panning options enable users to view the hidden portion of wide landscape
        images. The client/server architecture minimizes network traffic
        providing fast user command and display performance. When multiple
        images are visible, typically for portrait images on a wide screen
        device, the imagegroup can be framed to focus the viewers attention on
        a single image.  Full screen presentations disable the menus and
        toolbars providing a optimum image viewing experiences.<p>

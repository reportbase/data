        FSPIV creates 360 degree panoramas from image montages that are resized to 
        full screen. <p><br>
        FSPIV divides the panorama into slices and draws only those that are 
        visible to the viewer. 
        The 360 degree panorama is rotated as if standing
        in the middle of a cylinder.<p>
 
        FSPIV does not require specialized equipment or software and 
        works with all browser supported images. 
        FSPIV supports the wide image photography created 
        in today's popular mobile devices.<p>

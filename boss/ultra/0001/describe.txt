        RepbaView displays pictures at full screen height eliminating the time
        for users to pinch-out landscape photos to full screen. Images are
        stored in a cylinder format enabling wrap around parametric viewing.
        The cylindrical menus enable users to conveniently select documents,
        named picture subgroups, or commands.  As opposed to typical websites
        that stack pictures vertically, pictures are displayed horizontally,
        providing attractive continuous wrap around image viewing.
        To demonstrate how panning options enable users to view the hidden portion of wide landscape
        images, click on the above iframe images and enable the full screen icon to
        enable the Ultra landscape imagegroup. Click right side of screen several times to 
        advance images. When image is stopped, notice that the image is wider than you screen. Two ways to
        see the full image are 1) depress the cursor on the right or left side to see the full 
        image, and 2) pan left or right to see the full image. If not using an IOS device, select
        the fullscreen icon to view the images in full screen and repeat step 1 and 2 to view the full
        width of the wide images.  Mannually pinch the top, middle, or bottom of the screen to enable
        zoom.  Pince the screen again to disable Zoom. Tap the screen to center the image. Click
        back arrow to return to the home page.

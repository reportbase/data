        RepbaView stores images in a cylinder format that is rotated 360
        degrees to display panoramic or slideshow images.  The images are
        displayed by a rotating scan of the cylinder in either direction. The
        cylindrical image design is also used to implement RepbaView menus that
        provide convenient selection of image subgroups and documents.
        Image panorama or slideshow auto motion can be enabled as default or
        selectable speeds.  Manual screen gestures provide panning, movement of
        images, start auto motion, and stop auto motion.  User screen controls also
        allow users to view the hidden portions of landscape images.  Short
        press or pan the image when it extends beyond the horizontal ends of
        the screen. A no-auto-motion option is available
        to avoid inadvertent auto rotation during manual interaction steps.
        To demonstrate panorama and slideshow auto motion, click on the above iframe
        images and enable the full screen icon to
        activate the Ultra landscape imagegroup with full height image display. Using the image menu, select various 
        subgroup galleries and enable command menu panorama or slideshow motion.<p><br>

        RepbaView creates animated GIFs when building imagegroups. Gifs are
        useful for posting to social media and emails. Click on the following GIF image
        to enable the Express imagegroup having 7 subgroups each with 72 early 20th century paintings.
        View the different subgroups     
        by selecting the left menu icon. Enter the repba.com url to return to the home page and 
        perform step-6 of the RepbaView familization steps.<p>

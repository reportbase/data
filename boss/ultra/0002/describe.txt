            Image auto motion is provided in panorama or slideshow views. The motion type
            and speed can be enabled as default start-up options and manually controlled
            using the command menu. When motion is active, screen control icons are not
            displayed providing a quality viewing experience. Motion speed is controlled by
            manual swiping from low (fast) to high (slow) vertical position. The command
            menu restart button restarts motion at the same speed and direction. RepbaView
            supports a seamless transition between manual image control and auto motion.
            Auto motion is stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen enabling manual
            screen gestures or keyboard options. Manual controls provide panning,
            next/previous image selection, restart auto motion at same speed and direction,
            initiate new motion direction and speed, image magnification, images vertical
            rotation up or down, and image/command/thumbnail menus. The image and command
            menu icons are enabled when an image is stopped.  To demonstrate panorama and
            slideshow auto motion, click anywhere on the above iframe image to stop motion.
            Then click the “New Window” link below the iFrame display to activate the Ultra
            landscape imagegroup at full height display. Using the image menu, select
            various subgroup galleries using the top right command menu to select panorama
            or slideshow motion options. Use the back arrow to return to this page.<p><br>

            Browsers render images in portrait, forcing digital media to be resized to the
            screen's width.  Wide landscape images resized to the screen width require
            users to either rotate the device to landscape or pinch the image to full
            height.  RepbaView is a breakthrough rendering technology that addresses this
            limitation by rendering landscape media in a virtual panorama automatically
            resizing media to the screen height, not the screen width. This creates a full
            screen virtual panorama as some of a landscape image extends beyond the
            screen's horizontal boundary. RepbaView supports convenient viewing of the
            hidden ends of wide images. When the above iFrame image is at full height,
            stopped, and centered notice that the image is wider than the screen. To center
            an image, click the footer “+” icon to move to the next image. Pan left/right
            to view the non visible ends of the image when the view is constrained to the
            current image.  An effective horizontal panning method is to pan left or right
            from the center of the image. RepbaView also supports an assisted panning
            method where users only need a brief swipe at right/left image to view the page end. To easily
            sync up image postion, click the 
            center of the screen to view the subgroup thumbnail menu. <p><p> 
            RepbaView creates animated GIFs and
            imagegroup reports when building imagegroup montages in the RepaView cloud.
            GIFs are useful when including images to social media and emails. Click on the
            following GIF image to enable the Express imagegroup that has 7 subgroups each
            with 72 early 20th century paintings. View different subgroups by selecting
            buttons defined by the left image menu icon. Enter the repba.com url to return

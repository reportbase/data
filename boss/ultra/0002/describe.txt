        Imagegroup panorama or slideshow auto motion and speed can be enabled as a default start-up option or
        manually using the command menu.  Manual screen gestures provide panning, movement of
        images, start/stop auto motion.  Screen controls         
        also enable users to view the hidden portions of wide images.  A no-auto-motion option is available
        to avoid inadvertent auto rotation during manual interaction steps.
        To demonstrate panorama and slideshow auto motion, click the right or left side of the above iframe
        images to stop motion and pinch the screen to activate the Ultra landscape imagegroup with full height image display. Using the image menu, select various 
        subgroup galleries and use the top right command menu to select panorama or slideshow motion options. Use the back arrow to return to this page.<p><br>
	
	RepbaView supports viewing the hidden portion of wide 
        images, up/down image rotation, magnification of images when motion is stopped. When the top iFrame image is at full height, stopped, and centered notice that the image is wider than the screen. There are two ways to
        rotate the image and view its non visible ends: 1) depress the cursor on the right or left side, or 2) pan up/down. The center column of the screen is reserved for interactive image rotation and 
        zooming.  The arrows rotate the image up/down and the +/- icons increase/decrease magnification. 
        Rotate and magnify the image to become familar with these screen controls. Click right side of screen 
        to move to the center of the 
        next image. Select an image relative position by tapping the bottom of the screen. To perform these steps using a few image subgroups
        click on top iFrame right or left side to stop motion and pinch the screen to activate the Ultra imagegroup at full height.

        RepbaView - Viewing Hi-Resolution Images <p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="content" align=left style="font-size:medium">

            Browser and platform software have limited capabilities to view
            large Hi-Resolution images.  Hi-Resolution images are easy to
            create but hard to view.  Hi-Res images that have a height or width
            of 10K can be particularly challenging to view on small screens.  Click <a
            href="https://repba.com?p=boss/gush"> here</a> to view an example
            hi-resolution images in the Gush imagegroup.  Click the left menu
            icon to select other hi-resolution images.  <a
            href="https://repba.com?JTFW">Image #6</a> is a large high quality
            photo of a Florida golfcourse. <a
            href="https://repba.com?EXD4">Image #9</a> is hires  photo of a
            European tourist city.  Zoomin to view the tourists sitting by the
            river.  <p> <p>
	    
            The optimal way to pan large images is to resize the image to the 
            device's screen height and adjust the zoom level
            and vertical position to a restricted portion of image.
            
            This requires a little practice, but with the assistance of a thumbnail 
            image at the bottom of the screen, you can now easily pan large hi-res images.<p>
            
            The features consist of using two windows, working
            together, enable users to see both the selected zoom and vertical
            rotated image in perspective to the full image displayed in a
            second and smaller window.  Large image panning and motion controls
            are the same as normal full height images.  <p>  

            A large hi-res image is displayed at the top of page in an HTML
            iFrame. The smaller window is referred to as the “visual footer”
            that replaces the default footer that allows a user to move though
            a sequences of images.  Standard RepbaView screen user interaction
            controls enable users to fully view hi-res images. Using the top
            iFrame hi-res image, pan horizontally and vertically to see
            movement of the visual footer position bar.   Start panoramic
            motion with a horizontal swipe to see the position bar move across
            the full image displayed in the visual footer. Simply moving your
            finger or mouse on the screen moves the image accordingly.  
		    <p> 
               
            The “visual footer” is designed to show the selected full height
            image in relation to the full image.  It contains a moving vertical
            position bar that includes a red segment showing how the large
            screen image relates to the full image.  The red segment of the
            visual footer position bar instantanously reflects horizontal and
            vertical panning position adjustments and active motion.  If a
            hi-res image consists of multiple sub-images, panning is
            constrained to the active sub-image for both the full display and
            visual footer. The user can select a specific active sub-image by
            clicking the visual footer area that represents the image. The
            vertical position bar is then moved to the selected sub-image.  To
            move the visual footer position bar to another sub-image, click the
            desired visual footer image segment. <p>

            2) Pan vertically to move the image up/down. <br>
            3) Start panoramic motion by a screen swipe or using the command menu. <br>
            4) Stop panoramic motion by clicking anywhere on the screen. <br>
            5) Click the bottom of the image to enable the visual footer and click random locations of the full
               image or visual footer to see the corresponding change to the larger image. <br>

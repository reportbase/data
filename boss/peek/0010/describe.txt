            View images in full screen panorama using cell phones, tablets and PC screens.
            Websites typically stack pictures vertically and employ thumbnails, whereas
            RepbaView full screen images are displayed horizontally, providing continuous
            wrap around image viewing. Displaying new pages at the 
            screen top enhances the user experience over that of vertically
            panning new pages.  RepbaView is a visionary web application initiative that
            uses proprietary cylindrical panorama algorithms to display full height images
            horizontally. It delivers full height, panoramic motion images to parent web
            sites, emails, or social media using iFrames, GIFs, or URLs. <p><p>
            
            RepbaView challenges the status-quo of image technology providing a platform
            based on cloud image deployment, full height client side image rendering, and
            intuitive user interface. Landscape image collections that demand optimum
            visual quality are prime opportunities to take
            advantage of RepbaView full height panorama or slideshow displays. RepbaView creates emotion
            by adding motion to static photography making images fun to browse. It
            employs a client/server architecture using the browser canvas and GPU interface 
            to display image collections at high performance and
            superb quality. Its design splits image montages into hundreds of slices and
            individually renders them horizontally in real-time. 
            RepbaView's cylindrical panoramic design is used to
            render images and create innovative menus. In addition to its core
            image rendering capabilities, RepbaView is a breakthrough technology
            that supports advanced image solutions including 360 degree panoramas, motion
            pictures, and graphic novels. Each of these solutions are summarized by
            separate pages below.  <br><p>

            The following page links summarize each of these solutions using example imagegroups. 
            Although the solutions are significantly different from a user perspective, they employ the same 
            core RepaView technology.  The 360&deg; panoramas are deployed in a cylindrical panorama to display 
            <a target=ifr href="/?p=boss/land&k=0000&a=1&s=2&f=1">360&deg; panorama</a> projected (VR) and non projected panorama images.  
            Motion Picture solutions involve extracting select digital images from videos into RepbaView 
            <a target=ifr href="/?p=boss/golfer/0002&k=0001&a=2&s=2&f=1&z=1&r=2">motion picture</a> solutions that provide viewing 
            advantages over videos for brief action videos such as golf swings. The 
            <a target=ifr href="/?p=boss/golfer/0002&k=0001&a=2&s=2&f=1&z=1&r=2">graphic novel</a>
            solutions deploy short story and comic pages containing graphics with embeded text as RepbaView imagegroups.  
            Each of the image solutions utilize a browser to render their respective images.<p><p>

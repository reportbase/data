    </div>

	<div align=left style="font-size:medium">

            View images in full screen panorama using cell phones, tablets and
            PC screens.  Websites typically stack pictures vertically and
            employ thumbnails, whereas RepbaView full screen images are
            displayed horizontally, providing continuous wrap around image
            viewing. Displaying new pages at the screen top enhances the user
            experience over that of vertically panning new pages.  RepbaView is
            a visionary web application initiative that uses proprietary
            cylindrical panorama algorithms to display full height images
            horizontally. It delivers full height, panoramic motion images to
            parent web sites, emails, or social media using iFrames, GIFs, or
            URLs. RepbaView is a high resolution image viewer for wide media
            supporting picture in picture panning, grapic novels,
            animated sequences and panoramic slideshows. <p><p>
            
            RepbaView challenges the status-quo of image technology providing a
            platform based on cloud image deployment, full height client side
            image rendering, and intuitive user interface. Landscape image
            collections that demand optimum visual quality are prime
            opportunities to take advantage of RepbaView full height panorama
            or slideshow displays. RepbaView creates emotion by adding motion
            to static photography making images fun to browse. It employs a
            client/server architecture using the browser canvas and GPU
            interface to display image collections at high performance and
            superb quality. Its design splits image montages into hundreds of
            slices and individually renders them horizontally in real-time.
            RepbaView's cylindrical panoramic design is used to render images
            and create innovative menus. <br><p>

            RepbaView images can integrated into web pages using
            an HTML Iframe and a rich messaging API. In addition to its core image
            rendering capabilities, RepbaView is a breakthrough technology that
            supports advanced image solutions including viewing large hi-resolution images, 360 degree panoramas,
            motion pictures, and graphic novels. Each of these solutions are
            summarized by separate pages below.  <br><p>

            8. The RepbaView architecture enables advanced imaging solutions. This section summarizes 5 RepbaView 
	    image solutions that are explained using example imagegroups applicable to the solution. A separate 
            web page summary is provided for each of the solutions. The solutions provide user access to High-Resolution, 
            360° panoramas, virtual reality, graphic novels, and motion pictures images. The following hightlighted 
            page links refer to each of these solutions. The solutions utilize the web application RepbaView and 
            a browser to render their respective images. The RepbaView visual footer is used by the Hi-Res, 
            360° panorama, and VR solutions to enhance user visual presentation. <br> <p>

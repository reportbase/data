            Image auto motion is provided in panorama or slideshow views. The
            motion type and speed are enabled as default start-up options or
            manually controlled using the command menu. When motion is active,
            screen control icons are not displayed providing a quality non
            cluttered viewing experience. Motion speed is controlled by manual
            swiping from high (slow) to low (fast) vertical position. Swiping
            in the vertical middle of the screen provides the normal default
            motion speed. The command menu restart button restarts motion at
            the previous speed and direction. RepbaView supports a seamless
            transition between manual image control and auto motion.  In full mode
            auto motion is stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen that enables
            the footer, image menu icon, command menu icon,  interactive screen
            gestures, and keyboard options. In iframe mode, the footer and menus
            are disabled. Interactive controls provide
            panning, next/previous image selection, restart auto motion at same
            speed and direction, initiate new motion direction and speed, image
            magnification, images vertical rotation up or down, and visual
            image or thumbnail menus. Refer to the command menu help button for
            a summary of interactive screen controls.   <p><br>

            Browsers render images in portrait, forcing digital media to be
            resized to the screen's width.  Wide landscape images resized to
            the screen width require users to either rotate the device to
            landscape or pinch the image to full height.  RepbaView is a
            breakthrough rendering technology that addresses this limitation by
            rendering landscape media in a virtual panorama automatically
            resizing media to the screen height, not the screen width. This
            creates a full screen virtual panorama where part of a landscape
            image may extend beyond the screen's horizontal boundary. When the
            above iFrame image is stopped, and centered notice that the image
            is wider than the screen. 
            Pan left/right to view the non
            visible ends of the image when the view is constrained to the
            current image.  An effective horizontal panning method is to pan
            left or right from the center of the image. RepbaView also supports
            an assisted panning method when panoramic motion is enabled, where
            users only need a brief swipe at right/left image to accelerate
            view of the next page.  <p><p> 
            
            RepbaView creates animated GIFs and imagegroup reports when
            building imagegroup montages in the RepaView cloud.  GIFs are
            useful when including images to social media and emails. Click on
            the following GIF image to enable the "abstract" imagegroup that
            has 20 subgroups each with 72 early 20th century paintings. View
            different subgroups by selecting visual images enabled by the image
            menu icon. While viewing the images, perform some of the above
            actions to become familiar with the various screen motion
            interactive controls.  Enter the repba.com url to return to the

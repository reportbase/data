        Generate RepaView motion pictures by exporting specific video frames to an imagegroup
        creating short, fast loading, zoomable, variable speed motion
        pictures with auto replay.  The above motion picture is a golf
        swing exported from a 60fps 4K video. Swing videos captures at 30fps or 60fps typically use 54 RepbaView images. 
        This methodology also supports creation of time elapsed motion pictures.<p><br>

        Tap one of the top images and click the toolbar fullscreen icon to
        enable the full height view.  Swipe left on the top left 1/3 screen to enable
        a slow swing.  Swipe left on the bottom left 1/3 screen to enable a fast motion swing.
        Refer to the command help menu and tap the right screen to move forward one frame and
        left side of the screen to move backward one frame. See if you can position the club head nudging the ball
        slightly off the golf tee.  This type of focused control is 
        difficult using videos.   Click the top left menu "home/Jimmy" button to enable
        menu of other golfers.  Select another golfer to view their swings. Click the browser back arrow or enter the 
        repba.com url to return to the home page. <p><br>

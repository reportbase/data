        Create motion pictures by exporting video frames into an imagegroup.
        This creates short, fast loading, zoomable, variable speed motion
        pictures with automatic replay.  The above motion picture is a golf
        swing exported from a 4K video. This methodology also supports creation
        of time elapsed motion pictures.<p><br>

        Tap one of the top images and click the toolbar fullscreen icon to
        enable the full height view.  Swipe left on top of screen to enable
        a slow swing.  Swipe left on bottom of screen to enable a fast motion swing.
        Refer to the command help menu and tap the right screen to move forward and
        left side of the screen to move backward one image. See if you can position the club head nudging the ball
        slightly off the golf tee.  This type of focused control is 
        difficult using videos.   Click the top left menu "home/Jimmy" button to enable
        a menu of other golfers.  Select another golfer to view their swings.  <p><br>

        Create motion pictures by exporting video frames into an imagegroup.
        This creates short, fast loading, zoomable, variable speed motion
        pictures with automatic replay.  The above motion picture is a golf
        swing exported from a 4K video. This methodology also supports creation
        of time elapsed motion pictures.<p><br>

        Tap one of the top images and click the toolbar fullscreen icon to
        enable the full height view.  Swipe left top/bottom of screen to enable
        show/fast swing.  Refer to the command help menu and tap the right or
        left side of the screen to position the club head nudging the ball
        slightly off the golf tee.  This type of focused control is very
        difficult with videos.   Click the top left menu to load another golf
        swing. Each of the 3 iFrame golf swings below can be manually interacted with or enabled at 
        full height.  <p><br>

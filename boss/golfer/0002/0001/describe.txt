        Create motion pictures by exporting video frames into 
        panoramas.  This is useful to create short, fast loading videos,
        that are zoomable.  The above motion picture is a 
        panoramic slideshow of a complete golfswing, exported from a 4K video.<p><br>
        
        Tap the image and hit the three dots to load
        the panorama into full screen.  Once in full screen, zoom the image and
        watch the ball move slightly off the golf tee.  This type of focused control is
        very difficult with videos.   Exporting portions of a video into a panorama
        allow for very focused presentations.<p>

        Swipe the top of the panorma to slow the speed. Swipe the bottom of the 
        panorama to increase the speed.  Click the left side to move to the previous frame.
        Click the right side to move to the next frame.  Click the top
        left menu to load another golf swing.  Click the top right menu for other 
        options.

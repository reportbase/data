        RepaView motion pictures are created by exporting specific focused video frames from an .mov file to an 
imagegroup providing user advantages over .mov videos. Key features include short, fast loading, zoomable, variable 
speed, auto replay, menu selectable, individual image selectable, played by standard browser, and manual screen 
interaction control.  The above motion picture is a golf swing exported from a 60fps 4K .mov video.  Videos captured 
at 30fps or 60fps typically use 54 RepbaView images. The 60fps video removes some begin and end non critical swing 
images to fit within the 54 image total. The RepbaView motion picture file size is roughly 10% of its corresponding .mov 
file size. This methodology also supports creation of time elapsed motion pictures.</a> <p><br>

        Tap the bottom GIF image to enable the RepbaView motion picture at full height view.  Swipe screen top right

menu,  select image 38, 39, and 40 to position the club head nudging the ball slightly off the golf tee.  Next tune 
the vertical image position and magnify image size using the header -, + 13 level zoom controls and moving the vertical 
position by clicking center screen right or left sides.  The zoom and vertical position settings can be included as a

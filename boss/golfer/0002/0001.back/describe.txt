        RepaView motion pictures are created by exporting specific focused
        video frames from an .mov file to an imagegroup providing user
        advantages over .mov videos. Key features include short, fast loading,
        zoomable, variable speed, auto replay, menu selectable, individual
        image selectable, played by standard browser, and manual screen
        interaction control.  The above motion picture is a golf swing exported
        from a 60fps 4K .mov video.  Videos captured at 30fps or 60fps
        typically use 54 RepbaView images. This methodology also supports
        creation of time elapsed motion pictures.</a> <p><br>

        Tap the bottom GIF image to enable the RepbaView motion picture at full
        height view.  Swipe screen top right to enable a slow swing.  Swipe
        screen bottom right to enable fast swing motion and swipe center screen
        enable normal speed.  Stop the swing by clicking anywhere on the
        screen, and then click low on the screen to enable the footer.  Use the
        - and + icons to move forward or backward one frame.  Select image 38,
        39, and 40 to position the club head nudging the ball slightly off the
        golf tee.  Optionally, tune the image view by using the header zoom
        controls and moving the vertical position by vertical panning.  The
        zoom and vertical position settings can be included as a url parameter
        to enable a specific tuned image view. Click the top left menu "Jimmy"
        button to enable a menu of 10 other golfer RepbaView motion pictures.
        Select other golfers to view their swings. This demonstrates how
        RepbaView can effectively enable users to interact with a collection of
        short motion pictures.  Enter repba.com url to return to the home page.

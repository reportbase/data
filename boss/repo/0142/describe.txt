            Browser and platform software have limited capabilities to view large
            and Hi-Resolution images.  The latest camera technologies take Hi-Resolution 
            images but do not provide features that effectively view them. 
            With large cellphones having only 800x500 pixels, Hi-Res images that have greater
            than 10K horizontal or vertical pixels are a challenge to view effectively. The challenge
            is further compounded by HTML not providing specific features to support viewing 
            large hi-res images.
           <p> <p>
	    
            After extensive
            investigation and testing of various alternatives to improve viewing of hi-res images, RepbaView 
            has successfully implemented features to enhance viewing large hi-res images.
            The features consist of using two windows that, working together, enable users to
            see both the selected zoom and vertical rotated image in perspective to the
            full image displayed in a second and smaller window.  Large image panning and motion controls are the 
            same as normal full height images.  <p>  

            An example large image is displayed by the top of page iFrame. The smaller window is
            referred to as the “visual footer” that replaces the default footer that allows
            users to move though a sequences of images.  Standard RepbaView screen user interaction 
            controls enable users to fully view hi-res images. Using the top iFrame hi-res image, 
            pan horizontally and vertically to see movement of the visual footer position bar.  Also 
            start panoramic motion with a horizontal swipe to see the 
            position bar move across the full image displayed in the visual footer. Simply moving your 
            finger or mouse on the screen moves the image accordingly.  
		<p> 
               
            A key
            factor that influences how hi-res RepbaView features are designed is the image pixel
            size limitation of various client planforms.  Since IOS devices have the least
            image pixel capacity it dictates how large hi-res images are divided into multiple
            sub-images. Another key factor is that horizontal manual and depress panning
            stay within the active sub-image while panoramic auto motion moves across all the sub-images
            that comprise the large hi-res image.  <p> 

            The “visual footer” is designed to show the selected full height image in relation to the full image.  
            It contains a moving vertical position bar that includes a red segment showing how the 
            large screen image relates to the small screen full image.  The red segment of the visual 
            footer position bar instantanously reflects
            horizontal and vertical panning position adjustments and active motion. By horizontal panning 
            or edge screen depress, users can view the visual footer image to determine how many 
            individual sub-images comprise the hi-res image. 
            If a hi-res image consists of multiple sub-images, panning is constrained to the active
            sub-image for both the full display and visual footer. The user can select a specific active
            sub-image by clicking the visual footer area that represents the image. The vertical position
            bar is then moved to the selected sub-image.  To move the visual footer position bar to another
            sub-image, click the desired visual footer image segment. <p>

            Click the New Window link below the top of page iFrame image to enable the full height
            display of the top image. Click the left image icon to select
            various subgroups, as defined below, to demonstrate RepaView’s features to view
            large and Hi-Resolution images.  <p> 
            For each image,<br> 
            1) Zoom using the header by clicking the top display row. <br>
            2) Pan vertically to rotate the image. <br>
            3) Start panoramic motion by a screen swipe or using command menu. <br>
            4) Stop panoramic motion by clicking anywhere on the screen. <br>
            5) Select specific sub-images of the hi-res image by clicking the visual footer.<br>
            6) Click the browser back arrow to return to this page. <p>

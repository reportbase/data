        RepbaView is an excellent tool to view 360&deg; images. This 
        is accomplished by using the panorama, slideshow or manual
        viewing options. Each panorama or slideshow automated view shows a
        portion of the overall 360&deg; image.  Manual
        image interaction is an effective way to view 360&deg; images. The
        image can be viewed manually using panning, cursor depress, or clicking
        right/left side of screen to move forward/reverse one image. When
        viewing 360&deg; images, the interior of RepbaView image cylinder is painted
        with the image. 360&deg; panoramic images rotate continuously without an
        inherent left or right side.  <a href=/?p=boss/repba&k=0020&d=0&z=0&c=0&r=0&a=1>Click here</a> to view

        The cylindrical image processing design of RepbaView enables it to display popular 
        projection 360&deg; images.  It supports viewing equirectangular, cylindrical, and 
        rectilinear projection images.  Since it connects the ends of the image, it can
        display a wide range of projection 360&deg; image sizes providing a wrap around panning view.
        The design allows it to display various image aspect ratios. For example a 2:1 image can zoomed to viewable 
        4:1 or 8:1 image. RepbaView displays projection 360&deg; images that include a front & back image. 
        A user can view the front or back image separately or pan across the entire image. This also supports
        a slideshow view of an imagegroup consisting of many different projection 360&deg; images.<p><p>

        A browser does not properly display projection 360&deg; images. Special software is needed to view
        projection panorama images.  RepbaView is designed to view these images. 
        <a href=/?p=boss/repba&k=0021&a=0>click here</a> to see how RepbaView displays the image.<p>
        
        The tree imagegroup has 9 subgroups each         
        with 12 example projection 360&deg; images. Each of the subgroups can be viewed as 
        a panorama or slideshow.  Projection 360&deg; panorama subgroups can be included in an imagegroup with other 
        subgroup images and documents. 
        There are two key zooming selections: rotation and magnification. Zooming is
        particularly important for projection 360&deg images to obtain a quality user view. 
        Screen rotation and magnification steps are 
        likely needed to properly display specific portions of the image. Reference the command menu help button for
        detailed command and screen interaction information. Panning keeps the active left & right images of the panorama 
        displayed without moving to the next image.  The right or left arrows
        move to the next projection 360&deg; image in the subgroup. RepaView allows viewing projection 360&deg; panoramas without using
        special headsets. <a href=/?p=boss/repba&k=0022&a=0>Click here</a> to activate the tree imagegroup explained herein and perform the

        RepbaView is an excellent tool to view 360 degree
        images. This is accomplished by using the panorama, slideshow or manual
        viewing options. Each panorama or slideshow automated view shows a
        portion of the overall 360 degree image.  Manual
        image interaction is an effective way to view 360 degree images. The
        image can be viewed manually using panning, cursor depress, or clicking
        right/left side of screen to move forward/reverse one image. When
        viewing 360 degree images, the entire Repba image cylinder is consumed
        with the image. 360 Panoramic images rotate continuously without an
        inherent left or right side.<p><br>
    	
        Tap the top iFrame RepbaView image and click the toolbar fullscreen
        icon to enable full height view of the 360 image. Refer to the command
        help display to perform manual image interaction steps. Pan left, pan
        right, briefly depress right screen, briefly depress left screen to
        manually rotate the image. Click screen to stop rotation and click
        toolbar right arrow to start rotation. Then select panarama and
        slideshow auto motions. <a href=/?p=boss/land/0004&k=0003&a=1&s=400

                       Projection 360 Images<p><p>

        The cylindrical image processing design of RepbaView enables it to display popular 
        projection 360 images.  It supports viewing equirectangular, cylindrical, and 
        rectilinear projection images.  Since it connects the ends of the image, it can
        display a wide range of projection 360 image sizes providing a wrap around panning view.
        The design allows it to display various image aspect ratios. For example a 2:1 image can zoomed to viewable 
        4:1 or 8:1 images. RepbaView can display projection 360 images that include a front & back image. 
        A user can view the front or back image separately or pan accross the entire image. This also supports
        a slideshow view of an imagegroup conisting of many different projection 360 images.<p>

        A browser does not properly display projection 360 images. Special software is needed to view
        these panamara images.  RepbaView is desiged to view these images. Click here to see how a 
        browser displays the cityscape drone image versus click here to see how RepbaView displays the same image. <p>   

        
        Examples of projections images can be
        found at <a href=/?p=boss/tree&k=0004&e=0&s=1&f=1&a=1>here</a>.
        Five 
        imagegroups each having 20 images are provided as examples. Each of the imagegroups can be viewed as 
        a slideshow or manually.  There are two key zooming selections: zoom area and magnification. Zooming is
        particularily important for projection 360 images to obtain quality user views.  To prevent panaramic 
        distortions, zooming is constrained to 75% of the image. Reference the command menu help button for
        detailed zoom information.  The following are other key user interface commands.<p>
        Move image left or right by horizontal panning<p>
        Keyboard up/down arrows to move up and down accross the image.<p>
        Click right/left of screen move to next/previous image.<p>

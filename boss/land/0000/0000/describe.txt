        RepbaView is an excellent tool to view 360 degree
        images. This is accomplished by using the panorama, slideshow or manual
        viewing options. Each panorama or slideshow automated view shows a
        portion of the overall 360 degree image.  Manual
        image interaction is an effective way to view 360 degree images. The
        image can be viewed manually using panning, cursor depress, or clicking
        right/left side of screen to move forward/reverse one image. When
        viewing 360 degree images, the entire Repba image cylinder is consumed
        with the image. 360 Panoramic images rotate continuously without an
        inherent left or right side.<p><br>

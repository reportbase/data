        RepbaView is an excellent tool to view 360&deg; images. This 
        is accomplished by using the panorama, slideshow or manual
        viewing options. Each panorama or slideshow automated view shows a
        portion of the overall 360&deg; image.  Manual
        image interaction is an effective way to view 360&deg; images. The
        image can be viewed manually using panning, cursor depress, or clicking
        right/left side of screen to move forward/reverse one image. When
        viewing 360&deg; images, the entire RepbaView image cylinder is consumed
        with the image. 360&deg; panoramic images rotate continuously without an
        inherent left or right side.<p><br>
    	
        Tap the top iFrame image and click the toolbar fullscreen
        icon to enable the full height view of the 360&deg; image. Refer to the command
        help button to perform manual image interaction steps. Pan left, pan
        right, briefly depress right screen, briefly depress left screen to
        manually rotate the image. Click screen to stop rotation and click
        toolbar arrow to restart rotation. Then select panorama and
        slideshow auto motions. <a href=/?p=boss/land/0004&k=0003&a=1&s=400

        The cylindrical image processing design of RepbaView enables it to display popular 
        projection 360&deg; images.  It supports viewing equirectangular, cylindrical, and 
        rectilinear projection images.  Since it connects the ends of the image, it can
        display a wide range of projection 360&deg; image sizes providing a wrap around panning view.
        The design allows it to display various image aspect ratios. For example a 2:1 image can zoomed to viewable 
        4:1 or 8:1 image. RepbaView displays projection 360&deg; images that include a front & back image. 
        A user can view the front or back image separately or pan accross the entire image. This also supports
        a slideshow view of an imagegroup consisting of many different projection 360&deg; images.<p><p>

        A browser does not properly display projection 360&deg; images. Special software is needed to view
        projection panomara images.  RepbaView is desiged to view these images.

        <a href=/?p=boss/tree&k=0006&e=0&s=1&f=0&a=1>click here</a> to see RepbaView properly displays the image.
        <a href=/data/boss/tree/html/0007.html>Click here</a> to enable browser display of 12 car interiors 360&deg; images. Note 
        distorted images. Click the images to see how RepbaView properly displays the images.  <p> 
        
        <a href=/?p=boss/tree&k=0005&a=1&s=1&z=2&c=2&f=0>Click here</a> to activate the tree imagegroup that has 9 subgroups each         
        having 20-40 example 360&deg; images. Each of the subgroups can be viewed as 
        a panorama, slideshow or manually.  Projection 360&deg; panorama subgroups can be included in an imagegroup with other subgroup images and documents. 
        There are two key zooming selections: rotation and magnification. Zooming is
        particularily important for projection 360 images to obtain a quality user view. The center column of the screen is reserved for 
        interactive image rotation and 
        zooming.  The center column arrows rotate the image up/down and the +/- icons increase or decrease magnification. To prevent panoramic 
        edge distortions, image framing (&f=0 in url) is recommended. Screen rotation and magnification steps are 
        likely needed to properly display specific portions of the image.  Reference the command menu help button for
        detailed command and screen interaction information. Panning keeps the active left & right images of the panorama displayed without moving to the next image.  The right or left arrows
        move to the next projection 360&deg; image in the subgroup. RepaView allows viewing projection 360&deg; panoramas without using
        special headsets. Click the browser back arrow or enter the repba.com url to return to the home page.

Repba makes high resolution images viewable on small screens.  Rather than
resizing the entire image to fit the width of the screen, repbaview shows only
a portion of the image fit to the height of the screen.  The entire image is
then extended virtually beyond the screen boundaries  and pannable in all
directions.   This is a perfect solution for high resolution images when you
want to retain  as much image detail as possible but also make it viewable on small
screens.      Repbaview allows the original image to be viewed without any
reduction an image quality or tunned to smaller sizes for specific scerios.
This can be done because repbaview only shows a portion of the image at one
time and allows you to pan over the remainder.    Extremely high resolution
images can be viewed this way, virtually at very high image detail.  
With repbaview, original full quality images can be
viewed on small screens.  No longer does one need to sacrifice image quality for
screen size.    Show the original image without reduction in quality at
repbaview.

Repba makes high resolution images viewable on small screens.  Rather than
resizing the entire image to fit the width of the screen, Repbaview shows only
the visible portion of the image, resized to the height of the screen.  The
entire image is is then drawn virtually beyond the screen boundaries and
pannable in all directions.   This is a perfect solution for high detail, high
resolution images.  Repbaview can display large original images on small
screens with no reduction in quality.  At Repbaview, original high resolution
images can now be panned virtually at the original level of image quality.  At
Repbaview, no longer does one need to sacrifice image quality for screen size.

Repbaview organizes large collections of images for easy exploration and
discovery with its visual menu system. It shows the contents of image
collections with thumbnails of each image.   The menu can then be extended with
links to external documents.

Repbaview allows large images to be panned with its thumbnail footer.  The
thumbnail is panned independently of the main display.  Using the thumbnail, one
can always stay orientated as to which portion is currently in view.

Repbview can be automated with slideshows and inserted into web pages.  With
its rich URL and messaging system, you can now link to specific portions of an
image.  

All together, Repbaview is a very capable hi-resolution image viewer
with many additional features.   Visit repba.com or contact us at

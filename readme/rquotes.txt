After endless hours of looking at shrunken images over the years, what a treat
it is to look at the full detail of an image once again as if I was looking at
a large poster.  It makes looking at images enjoyable again.

I like looking at one photograph at at time, pause for 10 seconds and roll my
eyes over the entire photo with as big of a resolution as possible.

The web makes it hard to enjoy photography with all the multitude of screen distractions.

Great art deserves a great distraction free screen presentation.

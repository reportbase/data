To deploy images to FSPIV, download a project template and add your images.

Customize the configuration files to modify the user interface and text
labels and send it to deploy@fspiv.com.

If your needs are simple, select the following template and replace
the 72 images. <link>

The images must be the same height and width and an aspect ratio of
between 1.6 and 2.0. <link>

Rezip the project into a zip file and give it a unique filename, such
as apple.alpha.0001.zip,
[company.project.version.zip].

Within 24 hours, a unique url will be returned, such as
https://fspiv.com&k=apple.alpha.0001

The project template is described as follows:

alpha
    0000
        0000.jpg
        0001.jpg
        ...
        0071.jpg
    links.ini
    pages.ini
    photos.ini

1) Replace title names in links.ini
[]
Title = Toyota
Path = /?p=boss/cars&k=0000

2) Photo names in photos.ini
No changes needed if you adopt the project's naming conventions.

3) Pages.ini
No changes needed if you adopt the program's default options.

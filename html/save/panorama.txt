        Images are divided into slices and rotated around the user as 
        if they were standing in a cylinder. Only a portion of the panorama is
        visable at any given angle.  The entire panorama can be viewed 
        by rotating the cylinder.<p>

        Panoramic images rotate contiously without an inherent left or right side.

        are now possible with RepbaViewer.<p>

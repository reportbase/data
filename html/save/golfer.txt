        Create motion pictures by exporting video frames into 
        an image group.  This creates short, fast loading,
        zoomable, variable speed motion pictures with automatic replay.  The above motion picture is a 
        golfswing exported from a 4K video.<p><br>
        
        Tap the image and hit the three dots to load
        the panorama into full screen.  Once in full screen, refer to the help menu to enable various 
        swing speeds and
        tap the right or left side of the screen to position the club head nudging the ball
        slightly off the golf tee.
        This type of focused control is
        very difficult with videos.   
        Click the top
        left menu to load another golf swing.  <p>

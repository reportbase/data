       RepbaView is a high resolution image viewer for wide media.
        It supports picture in picture panning, grapic novels,
        animated sequences and panoramic slideshows.  

        RepbaView is integrated into web pages with
        an HTML Iframe and a rich messaging API.   
    
        RepbaView's advanced touch based interace allows 
        easy panning of wide images that are larger than the screen. 
        Touch the screen and pan the image in all directions.
        Press the screen to pan in-place.
        Swipe the screen to start the slideshow.

        High resolution images are viewed with picture in picture panning.
        Tap the forground image to navigate to any portion
        of the zoomed-in background image.  

        Wide image panorams are resized to the screen height and panned horizontally.  
        Start a panoramic slideshow with a quick horizontal swipe.

        Graphic novels are panned vertically, with the panning motion
        restricted to the current page.

        Animation sequences are panned in-place, similar to a
        motion picture video.
